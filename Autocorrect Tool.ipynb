      "As things now stand, the course of instruction in American history in\n",
      "our public schools embraces three distinct treatments of the subject.\n",
      "Three separate books are used. First, there is the primary book, which\n",
      "is usually a very condensed narrative with emphasis on biographies and\n",
      "anecdotes. Second, there is the advanced text for the seventh or eighth\n",
      "grade, generally speaking, an expansion of the elementary book by the\n",
      "addition of forty or fifty thousand words. Finally, there is the high\n",
      "school manual. This, too, ordinarily follows the beaten path, giving\n",
      "fuller accounts of the same events and characters. To put it bluntly, we\n",
      "do not assume that our children obtain permanent possessions from their\n",
      "study of history in the lower grades. If mathematicians followed the\n",
      "same method, high school texts on algebra and geometry would include the\n",
      "multiplication table and fractions.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is, of course, a ready answer to the criticism advanced above. It\n",
      "is that teachers have learned from bitter experience how little history\n",
      "their pupils retain as they pass along the regular route. No teacher of\n",
      "history will deny this. Still it is a standing challenge to existing\n",
      "methods of historical instruction. If the study of history cannot be\n",
      "made truly progressive like the study of mathematics, science, and\n",
      "languages, then the historians assume a grave responsibility in adding\n",
      "their subject to the already overloaded curriculum. If the successive\n",
      "historical texts are only enlarged editions of the first text--more\n",
      "facts, more dates, more words--then history deserves most of the sharp\n",
      "criticism which it is receiving from teachers of science, civics, and\n",
      "economics.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this condition of affairs we find our justification for offering a\n",
      "new high school text in American history. Our first contribution is one\n",
      "of omission. The time-honored stories of exploration and the\n",
      "biographies of heroes are left out. We frankly hold that, if pupils know\n",
      "little or nothing about Columbus, Cortes, Magellan, or Captain John\n",
      "Smith by the time they reach the high school, it is useless to tell the\n",
      "same stories for perhaps the fourth time. It is worse than useless. It\n",
      "is an offense against the teachers of those subjects that are\n",
      "demonstrated to be progressive in character.\n",

      "In the next place we have omitted all descriptions of battles. Our\n",
      "reasons for this are simple. The strategy of a campaign or of a single\n",
      "battle is a highly technical, and usually a highly controversial, matter\n",
      "about which experts differ widely. In the field of military and naval\n",
      "operations most writers and teachers of history are mere novices. To\n",
      "dispose of Gettysburg or the Wilderness in ten lines or ten pages is\n",
      "equally absurd to the serious student of military affairs. Any one who\n",
      "compares the ordinary textbook account of a single Civil War campaign\n",
      "with the account given by Ropes, for instance, will ask for no further\n",
      "comment. No youth called upon to serve our country in arms would think\n",
      "of turning to a high school manual for information about the art of\n",
      "warfare. The dramatic scene or episode, so useful in arousing the\n",
      "interest of the immature pupil, seems out of place in a book that\n",
      "deliberately appeals to boys and girls on the very threshold of life's\n",
      "serious responsibilities.\n",

      "show them that it is more dangerous to run away than to advance, but\n",
      "that Russian soldiers only need to be restrained and held back! On all\n",
      "sides, new and fresh anecdotes were heard of individual examples of\n",
      "heroism shown by our officers and men at Austerlitz. One had saved a\n",

      "Russian kaftans. Powdered footmen, in livery with buckled shoes and\n",
      "smart stockings, stood at every door anxiously noting visitors'\n",
      "every movement in order to offer their services. Most of those present\n",
      "were elderly, respected men with broad, self-confident faces, fat\n",
      "fingers, and resolute gestures and voices. This class of guests and\n",
      "members sat in certain habitual places and met in certain habitual\n",
      "groups. A minority of those present were casual guests--chiefly\n",
      "young men, among whom were Denisov, Rostov, and Dolokhov--who was\n",
      "now again an officer in the Semenov regiment. The faces of these young\n",
      "people, especially those who were militarymen, bore that expression of\n",
      "condescending respect for their elders which seems to say to the older\n",
      "generation, \"We are prepared to respect and honor you, but all the\n",
      "same remember that the future belongs to us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Nesvitski was there as an old member of the Club. Pierre, who at his\n",
      "wife's command had let his hair grow and abandoned his spectacles,\n",
      "went about the rooms fashionably dressed but looking sad and dull.\n",
      "Here, as elsewhere, he was surrounded by an atmosphere of subservience\n",
      "to his wealth, and being in the habit of lording it over these people,\n",

      "rubles I don't know what to do with, and she stands in her tattered\n",
      "cloak looking timidly at me,\" he thought. \"And what does she want\n",
      "the money for? As if that money could add a hair's breadth to\n",
      "happiness or peace of mind. Can anything in the world make her or me\n",
      "less a prey to evil and death?--death which ends all and must come\n",
      "today or tomorrow--at any rate, in an instant as compared with\n",

      "His servant handed him a half-cut novel, in the form of letters,\n",
      "by Madame de Souza. He began reading about the sufferings and virtuous\n",
      "struggles of a certain Emilie de Mansfeld. \"And why did she resist her\n",

      "into her heart an impulse that was against His will. My wife--as she\n",
      "once was--did not struggle, and perhaps she was right. Nothing has\n",

      "human wisdom.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything within and around him seemed confused, senseless, and\n",

      "Pierre took his feet off the table, stood up, and lay down on a\n",
      "bed that had been got ready for him, glancing now and then at the\n",
      "newcomer, who, with a gloomy and tired face, was wearily taking off\n",
      "his wraps with the aid of his servant, and not looking at Pierre. With\n",
      "a pair of felt boots on his thin bony legs, and keeping on a worn,\n",
      "nankeen-covered, sheepskin coat, the traveler sat down on the sofa,\n",
      "leaned back his big head with its broad temples and close-cropped\n",
      "hair, and looked at Bezukhov. The stern, shrewd, and penetrating\n",
      "expression of that look struck Pierre. He felt a wish to speak to\n",
      "the stranger, but by the time he had made up his mind to ask him a\n",
      "question about the roads, the traveler had closed his eyes. His\n",
      "shriveled old hands were folded and on the finger of one of them\n",
      "Pierre noticed a large cast iron ring with a seal representing a\n",
      "death's head. The stranger sat without stirring, either resting or, as\n",
      "it seemed to Pierre, sunk in profound and calm meditation. His servant\n",
      "was also a yellow, wrinkled old man, without beard or mustache,\n",
      "evidently not because he was shaven but because they had never\n",
      "grown. This active old servant was unpacking the traveler's canteen\n",
      "and preparing tea. He brought in a boiling samovar. When everything\n",
      "was ready, the stranger opened his eyes, moved to the table, filled\n",
      "a tumbler with tea for himself and one for the beardless old man to\n",
      "whom he passed it. Pierre began to feel a sense of uneasiness, and the\n",

      "What Pierre did not know was that the place where they presented him\n",

      "day, and that the richest peasants (who formed the deputation) had\n",
      "begun the chantry long before, but that nine tenths of the peasants in\n",

      "that since the nursing mothers were no longer sent to work on his\n",
      "land, they did still harder work on their own land. He did not know\n",
      "that the priest who met him with the cross oppressed the peasants by\n",
      "his exactions, and that the pupils' parents wept at having to let\n",
      "him take their children and secured their release by heavy payments.\n",
      "He did not know that the brick buildings, built to plan, were being\n",
      "built by serfs whose manorial labor was thus increased, though\n",
      "lessened on paper. He did not know that where the steward had shown\n",
      "him in the accounts that the serfs' payments had been diminished by\n",
      "a third, their obligatory manorial work had been increased by a\n",
      "half. And so Pierre was delighted with his visit to his estates and\n",
      "quite recovered the philanthropic mood in which he had left\n",

      "Pierre in his secret soul agreed with the steward that it would be\n",
      "difficult to imagine happier people, and that God only knew what would\n",
      "happen to them when they were free, but he insisted, though\n",
      "reluctantly, on what he thought right. The steward promised to do\n",
      "all in his power to carry out the count's wishes, seeing clearly\n",
      "that not only would the count never be able to find out whether all\n",
      "measures had been taken for the sale of the land and forests and to\n",
      "release them from the Land Bank, but would probably never even inquire\n",

      "a month, reviewing troops and holding maneuvers. Nothing was ready for\n",
      "the war that everyone expected and to prepare for which the Emperor\n",
      "had come from Petersburg. There was no general plan of action. The\n",
      "vacillation between the various plans that were proposed had even\n",
      "increased after the Emperor had been at headquarters for a month. Each\n",
      "of the three armies had its own commander in chief, but there was no\n",
      "supreme commander of all the forces, and the Emperor did not assume\n",
      "that responsibility himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The longer the Emperor remained in Vilna the less did everybody-\n",
      "tired of waiting--prepare for the war. All the efforts of those who\n",

      "his time pleasantly and forget that war was impending.\n",
      "\n",
      "In June, after many balls and fetes given by the Polish magnates, by\n",

      "Polish aides-de-camp in attendance that a dinner and ball should be\n",
      "given for the Emperor by his aides-de-camp. This idea was eagerly\n",
      "received. The Emperor gave his consent. The aides-de-camp collected\n",
      "money by subscription. The lady who was thought to be most pleasing to\n",
      "the Emperor was invited to act as hostess. Count Bennigsen, being a\n",
      "landowner in the Vilna province, offered his country house for the\n",

      "his own age. He was meeting Helene in Vilna after not having seen\n",
      "her for a long time and did not recall the past, but as Helene was\n",

      "bare shoulders which emerged from a dark, gold-embroidered, gauze\n",

      "of it himself and unnoticed by others, never for an instant ceased\n",
      "to observe the Emperor who was in the same room. The Emperor was not\n",

      "slightly to the lady and turned to him. Hardly had Balashev begun to\n",
      "speak before a look of amazement appeared on the Emperor's face. He\n",
      "took Balashev by the arm and crossed the room with him,\n",
      "unconsciously clearing a path seven yards wide as the people on both\n",
      "sides made way for him. Boris noticed Arakcheev's excited face when\n",
      "the sovereign went out with Balashev. Arakcheev looked at the\n",
      "Emperor from under his brow and, sniffing with his red nose, stepped\n",
      "forward from the crowd as if expecting the Emperor to address him.\n",

      "garden, where, seeing Balashev and the Emperor returning to the\n",
      "veranda, he stood still. They were moving toward the door. Boris,\n",

      "would not make peace so long as a single armed enemy remained on\n",
      "Russian soil and told him to transmit those words to Napoleon.\n",
      "Alexander did not insert them in his letter to Napoleon, because\n",

      "man with plumes in his hat and black hair curling down to his\n",

      "that the war begun by no wish of mine may finish as quickly as\n",

      "\n",
      "And he went on to inquiries about the Grand Duke and the state of\n",

      "spent with him in Naples. Then suddenly, as if remembering his royal\n",
      "dignity, Murat solemnly drew himself up, assumed the pose in which\n",
      "he had stood at his coronation, and, waving his right arm, said:\n",

      "soon be brought before Napoleon himself. But instead of that, at the\n",
      "next village the sentinels of Davout's infantry corps detained him\n",
      "as the pickets of the vanguard had done, and an adjutant of the\n",

      "In the organism of states such men are necessary, as wolves are\n",
      "necessary in the organism of nature, and they always exist, always\n",
      "appear and hold their own, however incongruous their presence and\n",
      "their proximity to the head of the government may be. This\n",
      "inevitability alone can explain how the cruel Arakcheev, who tore\n",
      "out a grenadier's mustache with his own hands, whose weak nerves\n",
      "rendered him unable to face danger, and who was neither an educated\n",

      "could have been found him, but Marshal Davout was one of those men who\n",
      "purposely put themselves in most depressing conditions to have a\n",
      "justification for being gloomy. For the same reason they are always\n",
      "hard at work and in a hurry. \"How can I think of the bright side of\n",

      "and necessity of such men, when they encounter anyone who shows\n",
      "animation, is to flaunt their own dreary, persistent activity.\n",
      "Davout allowed himself that pleasure when Balashev was brought in.\n",

      "which was animated by the beauty of the morning and by his talk with\n",
      "Murat, he did not rise or even stir, but scowled still more and\n",
      "sneered malevolently.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he noticed in Balashev's face the disagreeable impression\n",

      "And, as if to make the Russian general still more conscious of his\n",

      "on duty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Balashev took out the packet containing the Emperor's letter and\n",
      "laid it on the table (made of a door with its hinges still hanging\n",

      "\n",
      "The Comte de Turenne showed him into a big reception room where many\n",
      "generals, gentlemen-in-waiting, and Polish magnates--several of whom\n",
      "Balashev had seen at the court of the Emperor of Russia--were waiting.\n",

      "\n",
      "Balashev went into a small reception room, one door of which led\n",
      "into a study, the very one from which the Russian Emperor had\n",
      "dispatched him on his mission. He stood a minute or two, waiting. He\n",
      "heard hurried footsteps beyond the door, both halves of it were opened\n",
      "rapidly; all was silent and then from the study the sound was heard of\n",
      "other steps, firm and resolute--they were those of Napoleon. He had\n",
      "just finished dressing for his ride, and wore a blue uniform,\n",
      "opening in front over a white waistcoat so long that it covered his\n",
      "rotund stomach, white leather breeches tightly fitting the fat\n",
      "thighs of his short legs, and Hessian boots. His short hair had\n",
      "evidently just been brushed, but one lock hung down in the middle of\n",
      "his broad forehead. His plump white neck stood out sharply above the\n",
      "black collar of his uniform, and he smelled of Eau de Cologne. His\n",
      "full face, rather young-looking, with its prominent chin, wore a\n",
      "gracious and majestic expression of imperial welcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "He entered briskly, with a jerk at every step and his head\n",
      "slightly thrown back. His whole short corpulent figure with broad\n",
      "thick shoulders, and chest and stomach involuntarily protruding, had\n",
      "that imposing and stately appearance one sees in men of forty who live\n",
      "in comfort. It was evident, too, that he was in the best of spirits\n",
      "that day.\n",
      "\n",
      "He nodded in answer to Balashav's low and respectful bow, and coming\n",
      "up to him at once began speaking like a man who values every moment of\n",
      "his time and does not condescend to prepare what he has to say but\n",
      "is sure he will always say the right thing and say it well.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good day, General!\" said he. \"I have received the letter you\n",
      "brought from the Emperor Alexander and am very glad to see you.\" He\n",
      "glanced with his large eyes into Balashav's face and immediately\n",
      "looked past him.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was plain that Balashev's personality did not interest him at\n",
      "all. Evidently only what took place within his own mind interested\n",
      "him. Nothing outside himself had any significance for him, because\n",
      "everything in the world, it seemed to him, depended entirely on his\n",
      "will.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not, and did not, desire war,\" he continued, \"but it has\n",
      "been forced on me. Even now\" (he emphasized the word) \"I am ready to\n",
      "receive any explanations you can give me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And he began clearly and concisely to explain his reasons for\n",
      "dissatisfaction with the Russian government. Judging by the calmly\n",
      "moderate and amicable tone in which the French Emperor spoke, Balashev\n",
      "was firmly persuaded that he wished for peace and intended to enter\n",
      "into negotiations.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Napoleon, having finished speaking, looked inquiringly at the\n",
      "Russian envoy, Balashev began a speech he had prepared long before:\n",
      "\"Sire! The Emperor, my master...\" but the sight of the Emperor's\n",
      "eyes bent on him confused him. \"You are flurried--compose yourself!\"\n",
      "Napoleon seemed to say, as with a scarcely perceptible smile he looked\n",
      "at Balashev's uniform and sword.\n",
      "\n",
      "Balashev recovered himself and began to speak. He said that the\n",
      "Emperor Alexander did not consider Kurakin's demand for his\n",
      "passports a sufficient cause for war; that Kurakin had acted on his\n",
      "own initiative and without his sovereign's assent, that the Emperor\n",
      "Alexander did not desire war, and had no relations with England.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not yet!\" interposed Napoleon, and, as if fearing to give vent to\n",
      "his feelings, he frowned and nodded slightly as a sign that Balashev\n",
      "might proceed.\n",
      "\n",
      "After saying all he had been instructed to say, Balashev added\n",
      "that the Emperor Alexander wished for peace, but would not enter\n",
      "into negotiations except on condition that... Here Balashev hesitated:\n",
      "he remembered the words the Emperor Alexander had not written in his\n",
      "letter, but had specially inserted in the rescript to Saltykov and had\n",
      "told Balashev to repeat to Napoleon. Balashev remembered these\n",
      "words, \"So long as a single armed foe remains on Russian soil,\" but\n",
      "some complex feeling restrained him. He could not utter them, though\n",
      "he wished to do so. He grew confused and said: \"On condition that\n",
      "the French army retires beyond the Niemen.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Napoleon noticed Balashev's embarrassment when uttering these last\n",
      "words; his face twitched and the calf of his left leg began to\n",
      "quiver rhythmically. Without moving from where he stood he began\n",
      "speaking in a louder tone and more hurriedly than before. During the\n",
      "speech that followed, Balashev, who more than once lowered his eyes,\n",
      "involuntarily noticed the quivering of Napoleon's left leg which\n",
      "increased the more Napoleon raised his voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I desire peace, no less than the Emperor Alexander,\" he began.\n",
      "\"Have I not for eighteen months been doing everything to obtain it?\n",
      "I have waited eighteen months for explanations. But in order to\n",
      "begin negotiations, what is demanded of me?\" he said, frowning and\n",
      "making an energetic gesture of inquiry with his small white plump\n",
      "hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The withdrawal of your army beyond the Niemen, sire,\" replied\n",
      "Balashev.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Niemen?\" repeated Napoleon. \"So now you want me to retire\n",
      "beyond the Niemen--only the Niemen?\" repeated Napoleon, looking\n",
      "straight at Balashev.\n",
      "\n",
      "The latter bowed his head respectfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead of the demand of four months earlier to withdraw from\n",
      "Pomerania, only a withdrawal beyond the Niemen was now demanded.\n",
      "Napoleon turned quickly and began to pace the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You say the demand now is that I am to withdraw beyond the Niemen\n",
      "before commencing negotiations, but in just the same way two months\n",
      "ago the demand was that I should withdraw beyond the Vistula and the\n",
      "Oder, and yet you are willing to negotiate.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He went in silence from one corner of the room to the other and\n",
      "again stopped in front of Balashev. Balashev noticed that his left leg\n",
      "was quivering faster than before and his face seemed petrified in\n",
      "its stern expression. This quivering of his left leg was a thing\n",
      "Napoleon was conscious of. \"The vibration of my left calf is a great\n",
      "sign with me,\" he remarked at a later date.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Such demands as to retreat beyond the Vistula and Oder may be\n",
      "made to a Prince of Baden, but not to me!\" Napoleon almost screamed,\n",
      "quite to his own surprise. \"If you gave me Petersburg and Moscow I\n",
      "could not accept such conditions. You say I have begun this war! But\n",
      "who first joined his army? The Emperor Alexander, not I! And you offer\n",
      "me negotiations when I have expended millions, when you are in\n",
      "alliance with England, and when your position is a bad one. You\n",
      "offer me negotiations! But what is the aim of your alliance with\n",
      "England? What has she given you?\" he continued hurriedly, evidently no\n",
      "longer trying to show the advantages of peace and discuss its\n",
      "possibility, but only to prove his own rectitude and power and\n",
      "Alexander's errors and duplicity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The commencement of his speech had obviously been made with the\n",
      "intention of demonstrating the advantages of his position and\n",
      "showing that he was nevertheless willing to negotiate. But he had\n",
      "begun talking, and the more he talked the less could he control his\n",
      "words.\n",
      "\n",
      "The whole purport of his remarks now was evidently to exalt\n",
      "himself and insult Alexander--just what he had least desired at the\n",
      "commencement of the interview.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hear you have made peace with Turkey?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Balashev bowed his head affirmatively.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Peace has been concluded...\" he began.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Napoleon did not let him speak. He evidently wanted to do all\n",
      "the talking himself, and continued to talk with the sort of\n",
      "eloquence and unrestrained irritability to which spoiled people are so\n",
      "prone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I know you have made peace with the Turks without obtaining\n",
      "Moldavia and Wallachia; I would have given your sovereign those\n",
      "provinces as I gave him Finland. Yes,\" he went on, \"I promised and\n",
      "would have given the Emperor Alexander Moldavia and Wallachia, and now\n",
      "he won't have those splendid provinces. Yet he might have united\n",
      "them to his empire and in a single reign would have extended Russia\n",
      "from the Gulf of Bothnia to the mouths of the Danube. Catherine the\n",
      "Great could not have done more,\" said Napoleon, growing more and\n",
      "more excited as he paced up and down the room, repeating to Balashev\n",
      "almost the very words he had used to Alexander himself at Tilsit. \"All\n",
      "that, he would have owed to my friendship. Oh, what a splendid reign!\"\n",
      "he repeated several times, then paused, drew from his pocket a gold\n",
      "snuffbox, lifted it to his nose, and greedily sniffed at it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What a splendid reign the Emperor Alexander's might have been!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked compassionately at Balashev, and as soon as the latter\n",
      "tried to make some rejoinder hastily interrupted him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What could he wish or look for that he would not have obtained\n",
      "through my friendship?\" demanded Napoleon, shrugging his shoulders\n",
      "in perplexity. \"But no, he has preferred to surround himself with my\n",
      "enemies, and with whom? With Steins, Armfeldts, Bennigsens, and\n",
      "Wintzingerodes! Stein, a traitor expelled from his own country;\n",
      "Armfeldt, a rake and an intriguer; Wintzingerode, a fugitive French\n",
      "subject; Bennigsen, rather more of a soldier than the others, but\n",
      "all the same an incompetent who was unable to do anything in 1807\n",
      "and who should awaken terrible memories in the Emperor Alexander's\n",
      "mind.... Granted that were they competent they might be made use\n",
      "of,\" continued Napoleon--hardly able to keep pace in words with the\n",
      "rush of thoughts that incessantly sprang up, proving how right and\n",
      "strong he was (in his perception the two were one and the same)-\n",
      "\"but they are not even that! They are neither fit for war nor peace!\n",
      "Barclay is said to be the most capable of them all, but I cannot say\n",
      "so, judging by his first movements. And what are they doing, all these\n",
      "courtiers? Pfuel proposes, Armfeldt disputes, Bennigsen considers, and\n",
      "Barclay, called on to act, does not know what to decide on, and time\n",
      "passes bringing no result. Bagration alone is a military man. He's\n",
      "stupid, but he has experience, a quick eye, and resolution.... And\n",
      "what role is your young monarch playing in that monstrous crowd?\n",
      "They compromise him and throw on him the responsibility for all that\n",
      "happens. A sovereign should not be with the army unless he is a\n",
      "general!\" said Napoleon, evidently uttering these words as a direct\n",
      "challenge to the Emperor. He knew how Alexander desired to be a\n",
      "military commander.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The campaign began only a week ago, and you haven't even been\n",
      "able to defend Vilna. You are cut in two and have been driven out of\n",
      "the Polish provinces. Your army is grumbling.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"On the contrary, Your Majesty,\" said Balashev, hardly able to\n",
      "remember what had been said to him and following these verbal\n",
      "fireworks with difficulty, \"the troops are burning with eagerness...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know everything!\" Napoleon interrupted him. \"I know everything. I\n",
      "know the number of your battalions as exactly as I know my own. You\n",
      "have not two hundred thousand men, and I have three times that number.\n",
      "I give you my word of honor,\" said Napoleon, forgetting that his\n",
      "word of honor could carry no weight--\"I give you my word of honor that\n",
      "I have five hundred and thirty thousand men this side of the\n",
      "Vistula. The Turks will be of no use to you; they are worth nothing\n",
      "and have shown it by making peace with you. As for the Swedes--it is\n",
      "their fate to be governed by mad kings. Their king was insane and they\n",
      "changed him for another--Bernadotte, who promptly went mad--for no\n",
      "Swede would ally himself with Russia unless he were mad.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Napoleon grinned maliciously and again raised his snuffbox to his\n",
      "nose.\n",
      "\n",
      "Balashev knew how to reply to each of Napoleon's remarks, and\n",
      "would have done so; he continually made the gesture of a man wishing\n",
      "to say something, but Napoleon always interrupted him. To the\n",
      "alleged insanity of the Swedes, Balashev wished to reply that when\n",
      "Russia is on her side Sweden is practically an island: but Napoleon\n",
      "gave an angry exclamation to drown his voice. Napoleon was in that\n",
      "state of irritability in which a man has to talk, talk, and talk,\n",
      "merely to convince himself that he is in the right. Balashev began\n",
      "to feel uncomfortable: as envoy he feared to demean his dignity and\n",
      "felt the necessity of replying; but, as a man, he shrank before the\n",
      "transport of groundless wrath that had evidently seized Napoleon. He\n",
      "knew that none of the words now uttered by Napoleon had any\n",

      "meeting his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But what do I care about your allies?\" said Napoleon. \"I have\n",

      "\n",
      "And probably still more perturbed by the fact that he had uttered\n",

      "before him in the same attitude of submission to fate, Napoleon\n",
      "abruptly turned round, drew close to Balashev's face, and,\n",

      "he struck one of his small hands energetically with the other. \"Yes, I\n",
      "will throw you back beyond the Dvina and beyond the Dnieper, and\n",
      "will re-erect against you that barrier which it was criminal and blind\n",
      "of Europe to allow to be destroyed. Yes, that is what will happen to\n",
      "you. That is what you have gained by alienating me!\" And he walked\n",
      "silently several times up and down the room, his fat shoulders\n",
      "twitching.\n",
      "\n",
      "He put his snuffbox into his waistcoat pocket, took it out again,\n",
      "lifted it several times to his nose, and stopped in front of Balashev.\n",
      "He paused, looked ironically straight into Balashev's eyes, and said\n",
      "in a quiet voice:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And yet what a splendid reign your master might have had!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Balashev, feeling it incumbent on him to reply, said that from the\n",
      "Russian side things did not appear in so gloomy a light. Napoleon\n",
      "was silent, still looking derisively at him and evidently not\n",
      "listening to him. Balashev said that in Russia the best results were\n",
      "expected from the war. Napoleon nodded condescendingly, as if to\n",
      "say, \"I know it's your duty to say that, but you don't believe it\n",
      "yourself. I have convinced you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When Balashev had ended, Napoleon again took out his snuffbox,\n",

      "The door opened, a gentleman-in-waiting, bending respectfully,\n",
      "handed the Emperor his hat and gloves; another brought him a pocket\n",

      "General; you shall receive my letter to the Emperor.\"\n",

      "the last dryly spoken words: \"I will detain you no longer, General;\n",
      "you shall receive my letter,\" Balashev felt convinced that Napoleon\n",
      "would not wish to see him, and would even avoid another meeting with\n",
      "him--an insulted envoy--especially as he had witnessed his unseemly\n",
      "anger. But, to his surprise, Balashev received, through Duroc, an\n",

      "no sign of constraint or self-reproach on account of his outburst that\n",
      "morning, but, on the contrary, tried to reassure Balashev. It was\n",
      "evident that he had long been convinced that it was impossible for him\n",
      "to make a mistake, and that in his perception whatever he did was\n",
      "right, not because it harmonized with any idea of right and wrong, but\n",
      "because he did it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Emperor was in very good spirits after his ride through Vilna,\n",
      "where crowds of people had rapturously greeted and followed him.\n",
      "From all the windows of the streets through which he rode, rugs,\n",
      "flags, and his monogram were displayed, and the Polish ladies,\n",
      "welcoming him, waved their handkerchiefs to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "At dinner, having placed Balashev beside him, Napoleon not only\n",
      "treated him amiably but behaved as if Balashev were one of his own\n",

      "rejoice at his success. In the course of conversation he mentioned\n",
      "Moscow and questioned Balashev about the Russian capital, not merely\n",
      "as an interested traveler asks about a new city he intends to visit,\n",
      "but as if convinced that Balashev, as a Russian, must be flattered\n",
      "by his curiosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How many inhabitants are there in Moscow? How many houses? Is it\n",
      "true that Moscow is called 'Holy Moscow'? How many churches are\n",
      "there in Moscow?\" he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "And receiving the reply that there were more than two hundred\n",
      "churches, he remarked:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why such a quantity of churches?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Russians are very devout,\" replied Balashev.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But a large number of monasteries and churches is always a sign\n",
      "of the backwardness of a people,\" said Napoleon, turning to\n",
      "Caulaincourt for appreciation of this remark.\n",

      "Balashev respectfully ventured to disagree with the French Emperor.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "This reply of Balashev's, which hinted at the recent defeats of\n",
      "the French in Spain, was much appreciated when he related it at\n",
      "Alexander's court, but it was not much appreciated at Napoleon's\n",
      "dinner, where it passed unnoticed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The uninterested and perplexed faces of the marshals showed that\n",
      "they were puzzled as to what Balashev's tone suggested. \"If there is a\n",
      "point we don't see it, or it is not at all witty,\" their expressions\n",
      "seemed to say. So little was his rejoinder appreciated that Napoleon\n",
      "did not notice it at all and naively asked Balashev through what towns\n",
      "the direct road from there to Moscow passed. Balashev, who was on\n",
      "the alert all through the dinner, replied that just as \"all roads lead\n",
      "to Rome,\" so all roads lead to Moscow: there were many roads, and\n",
      "\"among them the road through Poltava, which Charles XII chose.\"\n",
      "Balashev involuntarily flushed with pleasure at the aptitude of this\n",
      "reply, but hardly had he uttered the word Poltava before\n",
      "Caulaincourt began speaking of the badness of the road from Petersburg\n",
      "to Moscow and of his Petersburg reminiscences.\n",
      "\n",
      "After dinner they went to drink coffee in Napoleon's study, which\n",
      "four days previously had been that of the Emperor Alexander.\n",
      "Napoleon sat down, toying with his Sevres coffee cup, and motioned\n",
      "Balashev to a chair beside him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Napoleon was in that well-known after-dinner mood which, more than\n",
      "any reasoned cause, makes a man contented with himself and disposed to\n",
      "consider everyone his friend. It seemed to him that he was\n",
      "surrounded by men who adored him: and he felt convinced that, after\n",
      "his dinner, Balashev too was his friend and worshiper. Napoleon turned\n",
      "to him with a pleasant, though slightly ironic, smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They tell me this is the room the Emperor Alexander occupied?\n",
      "Strange, isn't it, General?\" he said, evidently not doubting that this\n",

      "Napoleon's, superiority to Alexander.\n",
      "\n",
      "Balashev made no reply and bowed his head in silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes. Four days ago in this room, Wintzingerode and Stein were\n",
      "deliberating,\" continued Napoleon with the same derisive and\n",
      "self-confident smile. \"What I can't understand,\" he went on, \"is\n",
      "that the Emperor Alexander has surrounded himself with my personal\n",
      "enemies. That I do not... understand. Has he not thought that I may\n",
      "the same?\" and he turned inquiringly to Balashev, and evidently this\n",
      "thought turned him back on to the track of his morning's anger,\n",
      "which was still fresh in him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And let him know that I will do so!\" said Napoleon, rising and\n",
      "pushing his cup away with his hand. \"I'll drive all his Wurttemberg,\n",
      "Baden, and Weimar relations out of Germany.... Yes. I'll drive them\n",
      "out. Let him prepare an asylum for them in Russia!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Balashev bowed his head with an air indicating that he would like to\n",
      "make his bow and leave, and only listened because he could not help\n",
      "hearing what was said to him. Napoleon did not notice this expression;\n",
      "he treated Balashev not as an envoy from his enemy, but as a man now\n",
      "fully devoted to him and who must rejoice at his former master's\n",
      "humiliation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And why has the Emperor Alexander taken command of the armies? What\n",

      "responsibility?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Again Napoleon brought out his snuffbox, paced several times up\n",
      "and down the room in silence, and then, suddenly and unexpectedly,\n",
      "went up to Balashev and with a slight smile, as confidently,\n",
      "quickly, and simply as if he were doing something not merely\n",
      "important but pleasing to Balashev, he raised his hand to the\n",
      "forty-year-old Russian general's face and, taking him by the ear,\n",
      "pulled it gently, smiling with his lips only.\n",
      "\n",

      "always well disposed toward him, and Kutuzov suggested that he\n",
      "should accompany him to the army in Moldavia, to which the old general\n",

      "Andrew arrived, the latter returned to Russia. In a new country,\n",
      "amid new conditions, Prince Andrew found life easier to bear. After\n",
      "his betrothed had broken faith with him--which he felt the more\n",
      "acutely the more he tried to conceal its effects--the surroundings\n",
      "in which he had been happy became trying to him, and the freedom and\n",
      "independence he had once prized so highly were still more so. Not only\n",

      "enlarged upon with Pierre, and which had filled his solitude at\n",
      "Bogucharovo and then in Switzerland and Rome, but he even dreaded to\n",
      "recall them and the bright and boundless horizons they had\n",
      "revealed. He was now concerned only with the nearest practical matters\n",
      "unrelated to his past interests, and he seized on these the more\n",
      "eagerly the more those past interests were closed to him. It was as if\n",
      "that lofty, infinite canopy of heaven that had once towered above\n",
      "him had suddenly turned into a low, solid vault that weighed him down,\n",
      "in which all was clear, but nothing eternal or mysterious.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of the activities that presented themselves to him, army service was\n",

      "the consciousness that the insult was not yet avenged, that his rancor\n",

      "and the west), that on reaching Bald Hills it struck him as strange\n",
      "and unexpected to find the way of life there unchanged and still the\n",
      "same in every detail. He entered through the gates with their stone\n",
      "pillars and drove up the avenue leading to the house as if he were\n",
      "entering an enchanted, sleeping castle. The same old stateliness,\n",
      "the same cleanliness, the same stillness reigned there, and inside\n",
      "there was the same furniture, the same walls, sounds, and smell, and\n",
      "the same timid faces, only somewhat older. Princess Mary was still the\n",
      "same timid, plain maiden getting on in years, uselessly and\n",
      "joylessly passing the best years of her life in fear and constant\n",
      "suffering. Mademoiselle Bourienne was the same coquettish,\n",
      "self-satisfied girl, enjoying every moment of her existence and full\n",
      "of joyous hopes for the future. She had merely become more\n",
      "self-confident, Prince Andrew thought. Dessalles, the tutor he had\n",
      "brought from Switzerland, was wearing a coat of Russian cut and\n",
      "talking broken Russian to the servants, but was still the same\n",
      "narrowly intelligent, conscientious, and pedantic preceptor. The old\n",
      "prince had changed in appearance only by the loss of a tooth, which\n",
      "left a noticeable gap on one side of his mouth; in character he was\n",
      "the same as ever, only showing still more irritability and\n",
      "skepticism as to what was happening in the world. Little Nicholas\n",
      "alone had changed. He had grown, become rosier, had curly dark hair,\n",
      "and, when merry and laughing, quite unconsciously lifted the upper lip\n",
      "of his pretty little mouth just as the little princess used to do.\n",
      "He alone did not obey the law of immutability in the enchanted,\n",
      "sleeping castle. But though externally all remained as of old, the\n",
      "inner relations of all these people had changed since Prince Andrew\n",
      "had seen them last. The household was divided into two alien and\n",
      "hostile camps, who changed their habits for his sake and only met\n",
      "because he was there. To the one camp belonged the old prince,\n",
      "Madmoiselle Bourienne, and the architect; to the other Princess\n",
      "Mary, Dessalles, little Nicholas, and all the old nurses and maids.\n",
      "\n",
      "During his stay at Bald Hills all the family dined together, but\n",
      "they were ill at ease and Prince Andrew felt that he was a visitor for\n",
      "whose sake an exception was being made and that his presence made them\n",
      "all feel awkward. Involuntarily feeling this at dinner on the first\n",
      "day, he was taciturn, and the old prince noticing this also became\n",
      "morosely dumb and retired to his apartments directly after dinner.\n",
      "In the evening, when Prince Andrew went to him and, trying to rouse\n",
      "him, began to tell him of the young Count Kamensky's campaign, the old\n",
      "prince began unexpectedly to talk about Princess Mary, blaming her for\n",
      "her superstitions and her dislike of Mademoiselle Bourienne, who, he\n",
      "said, was the only person really attached to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The old prince said that if he was ill it was only because of\n",
      "Princess Mary: that she purposely worried and irritated him, and\n",
      "that by indulgence and silly talk she was spoiling little Prince\n",
      "Nicholas. The old prince knew very well that he tormented his daughter\n",
      "and that her life was very hard, but he also knew that he could not\n",
      "help tormenting her and that she deserved it. \"Why does Prince Andrew,\n",
      "who sees this, say nothing to me about his sister? Does he think me\n",
      "a scoundrel, or an old fool who, without any reason, keeps his own\n",
      "daughter at a distance and attaches this Frenchwoman to himself? He\n",
      "doesn't understand, so I must explain it, and he must hear me out,\"\n",
      "thought the old prince. And he began explaining why he could not put\n",
      "up with his daughter's unreasonable character.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you ask me,\" said Prince Andrew, without looking up (he was\n",
      "censuring his father for the first time in his life), \"I did not\n",
      "wish to speak about it, but as you ask me I will give you my frank\n",
      "opinion. If there is any misunderstanding and discord between you\n",
      "and Mary, I can't blame her for it at all. I know how she loves and\n",
      "respects you. Since you ask me,\" continued Prince Andrew, becoming\n",
      "irritable--as he was always liable to do of late--\"I can only say that\n",

      "woman, who is not fit to be my sister's companion.\"\n",

      "blame--is that Frenchwoman.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, he has passed judgment... passed judgement!\" said the old man\n",
      "in a low voice and, as it seemed to Prince Andrew, with some\n",
      "embarrassment, but then he suddenly jumped up and cried: \"Be off, be\n",
      "off! Let not a trace of you remain here!...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Prince Andrew wished to leave at once, but Princess Mary persuaded\n",
      "him to stay another day. That day he did not see his father, who did\n",
      "not leave his room and admitted no one but Mademoiselle Bourienne\n",
      "and Tikhon, but asked several times whether his son had gone. Next\n",
      "day, before leaving, Prince Andrew went to his son's rooms. The boy,\n",
      "curly-headed like his mother and glowing with health, sat on his knee,\n",
      "and Prince Andrew began telling him the story of Bluebeard, but fell\n",
      "into a reverie without finishing the story. He thought not of this\n",
      "pretty child, his son whom he held on his knee, but of himself. He\n",

      "momentarily on many and many faces he had met that morning; and\n",

      "It was Kutuzov, who had been riding round the position and on his\n",

      "kissed the icon as a child does with naively pouting lips, and again\n",
      "bowed till he touched the ground with his hand. The other generals\n",

      "\n",
      "Staggering amid the crush, Pierre looked about him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Count Peter Kirilovich! How did you get here?\" said a voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pierre looked round. Boris Drubetskoy, brushing his knees with his\n",
      "hand (he had probably soiled them when he, too, had knelt before the\n",
      "icon), came up to him smiling. Boris was elegantly dressed, with a\n",
      "slightly martial touch appropriate to a campaign. He wore a long\n",
      "coat and like Kutuzov had a whip slung across his shoulder.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile Kutuzov had reached the village and seated himself in\n",
      "the shade of the nearest house, on a bench which one Cossack had run\n",
      "to fetch and another had hastily covered with a rug. An immense and\n",
      "brilliant suite surrounded him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The icon was carried further, accompanied by the throng. Pierre\n",
      "stopped some thirty paces from Kutuzov, talking to Boris.\n",
      "\n",
      "He explained his wish to be present at the battle and to see the\n",
      "position.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is what you must do,\" said Boris. \"I will do the honors of the\n",
      "camp to you. You will see everything best from where Count Bennigsen\n",
      "will be. I am in attendance on him, you know; I'll mention it to\n",
      "him. But if you want to ride round the position, come along with us.\n",
      "We are just going to the left flank. Then when we get back, do spend\n",
      "the night with me and we'll arrange a game of cards. Of course you\n",
      "know Dmitri Sergeevich? Those are his quarters,\" and he pointed to the\n",
      "third house in the village of Gorki.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I should like to see the right flank. They say it's very\n",
      "strong,\" said Pierre. \"I should like to start from the Moskva River\n",
      "and ride round the whole position.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, you can do that later, but the chief thing is the left\n",
      "flank.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, yes. But where is Prince Bolkonski's regiment? Can you point\n",
      "it out to me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Prince Andrew's? We shall pass it and I'll take you to him.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\"To tell you the truth, between ourselves, God only knows what state\n",
      "our left flank is in,\" said Boris confidentially lowering his voice.\n",
      "\"It is not at all what Count Bennigsen intended. He meant to fortify\n",
      "that knoll quite differently, but...\" Boris shrugged his shoulders,\n",
      "\"his Serene Highness would not have it, or someone persuaded him.\n",
      "You see...\" but Boris did not finish, for at that moment Kaysarov,\n",
      "Kutuzov's adjutant, came up to Pierre. \"Ah, Kaysarov!\" said Boris,\n",
      "addressing him with an unembarrassed smile, \"I was just trying to\n",
      "explain our position to the count. It is amazing how his Serene\n",
      "Highness could so the intentions of the French!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You mean the left flank?\" asked Kaysarov.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, exactly; the left flank is now extremely strong.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Though Kutuzov had dismissed all unnecessary men from the staff,\n",
      "Boris had contrived to remain at headquarters after the changes. He\n",
      "had established himself with Count Bennigsen, who, like all on whom\n",
      "Boris had been in attendance, considered young Prince Drubetskoy an\n",
      "invaluable man.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the higher command there were two sharply defined parties:\n",
      "Kutuzov's party and that of Bennigsen, the chief of staff. Boris\n",
      "belonged to the latter and no one else, while showing servile\n",
      "respect to Kutuzov, could so create an impression that the old\n",
      "fellow was not much good and that Bennigsen managed everything. Now\n",
      "the decisive moment of battle had come when Kutuzov would be destroyed\n",
      "and the power pass to Bennigsen, or even if Kutuzov won the battle\n",
      "it would be felt that everything was done by Bennigsen. In any case\n",
      "many great rewards would have to be given for tomorrow's action, and\n",
      "new men would come to the front. So Boris was full of nervous vivacity\n",
      "all day.\n",
      "\n",
      "After Kaysarov, others whom Pierre knew came up to him, and he had\n",
      "not time to reply to all the questions about Moscow that were showered\n",
      "upon him, or to listen to all that was told him. The faces all\n",
      "expressed animation and apprehension, but it seemed to Pierre that the\n",
      "cause of the excitement shown in some of these faces lay chiefly in\n",
      "questions of personal success; his mind, however, was occupied by\n",
      "the different expression he saw on other faces--an expression that\n",
      "spoke not of personal matters but of the universal questions of life\n",
      "and death. Kutuzov noticed Pierre's figure and the group gathered\n",
      "round him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Call him to me,\" said Kutuzov.\n",
      "\n",
      "An adjutant told Pierre of his Serene Highness' wish, and Pierre\n",
      "went toward Kutuzov's bench. But a militiaman got there before him. It\n",

      "\n",
      "\"How did that fellow get here?\" asked Pierre.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He's a creature that wriggles in anywhere!\" was the answer. \"He has\n",
      "been degraded, you know. Now he wants to bob up again. He's been\n",
      "proposing some scheme or other and has crawled into the enemy's picket\n",
      "line at night.... He's a brave fellow.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "At the battle of Borodino Napoleon shot at no one and killed no one.\n",
      "That was all done by the soldiers. Therefore it was not he who\n",
      "killed people.\n",
      "\n",
      "The French soldiers went to kill and be killed at the battle of\n",
      "Borodino not because of Napoleon's orders but by their own volition.\n",
      "The whole army--French, Italian, German, Polish, and Dutch--hungry,\n",
      "ragged, and weary of the campaign, felt at the sight of an army\n",
      "blocking their road to Moscow that the wine was drawn and must be\n",
      "drunk. Had Napoleon then forbidden them to fight the Russians, they\n",
      "would have killed him and have proceeded to fight the Russians because\n",
      "it was inevitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they heard Napoleon's proclamation offering them, as\n",
      "compensation for mutilation and death, the words of posterity about\n",
      "their having been in the battle before Moscow, they cried \"Vive\n",
      "l'Empereur!\" just as they had cried \"Vive l'Empereur!\" at the sight of\n",
      "the portrait of the boy piercing the terrestrial globe with a toy\n",
      "stick, and just as they would have cried \"Vive l'Empereur!\" at any\n",
      "nonsense that might be told them. There was nothing left for them to\n",
      "do but cry \"Vive l'Empereur!\" and go to fight, in order to get food\n",
      "and rest as conquerors in Moscow. So it was not because of\n",
      "Napoleon's commands that they killed their fellow men.\n",
      "\n",
      "And it was not Napoleon who directed the course of the battle, for\n",
      "none of his orders were executed and during the battle he did not know\n",
      "what was going on before him. So the way in which these people\n",
      "killed one another was not decided by Napoleon's will but occurred\n",
      "independently of him, in accord with the will of hundreds of thousands\n",
      "of people who took part in the common action. It only seemed to\n",
      "Napoleon that it all took place by his will. And so the question\n",
      "whether he had or had not a cold has no more historic interest than\n",
      "the cold of the least of the transport soldiers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, the assertion made by various writers that his cold was\n",
      "the cause of his dispositions not being as well planned as on former\n",
      "occasions, and of his orders during the battle not being as good as\n",
      "previously, is quite baseless, which again shows that Napoleon's\n",
      "cold on the twenty-sixth of August was unimportant.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dispositions cited above are not at all worse, but are even\n",
      "better, than previous dispositions by which he had won victories.\n",
      "His pseudo-orders during the battle were also no worse than\n",
      "formerly, but much the same as usual. These dispositions and orders\n",
      "only seem worse than previous ones because the battle of Borodino\n",
      "was the first Napoleon did not win. The profoundest and most excellent\n",
      "dispositions and orders seem very bad, and every learned militarist\n",
      "criticizes them with looks of importance, when they relate to a\n",
      "battle that has been lost, and the very worst dispositions and\n",

      "Napoleon ordered another glass to be brought for Rapp, and silently\n",
      "sipped his own.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have neither taste nor smell,\" he remarked, sniffing at his\n",
      "glass. \"This cold is tiresome. They talk about medicine--what is the\n",

      "Pierre dressed hastily and ran out to the porch. Outside all was\n",
      "bright, fresh, dewy, and cheerful. The sun, just bursting forth from\n",

      "members of the staff could be heard conversing in French, and\n",
      "Kutuzov's gray head in a white cap with a red band was visible, his\n",

      "rays of the bright sun, rising slightly to the left behind Pierre,\n",
      "cast upon it through the clear morning air penetrating streaks of\n",
      "rosy, golden tinted light and long dark shadows. The forest at the\n",
      "farthest extremity of the panorama seemed carved in some precious\n",
      "stone of a yellowish-green color; its undulating outline was\n",
      "silhouetted against the horizon and was pierced beyond Valuevo by\n",
      "the Smolensk highroad crowded with troops. Nearer at hand glittered\n",
      "golden cornfields interspersed with copses. There were troops to be\n",
      "seen everywhere, in front and to the right and left. All this was\n",
      "vivid, majestic, and unexpected; but what impressed Pierre most of all\n",
      "was the view of the battlefield itself, of Borodino and the hollows on\n",
      "both sides of the Kolocha.\n",
      "\n",
      "Above the Kolocha, in Borodino and on both sides of it, especially\n",
      "to the left where the Voyna flowing between its marshy banks falls\n",
      "into the Kolocha, a mist had spread which seemed to melt, to dissolve,\n",
      "and to become translucent when the brilliant sun appeared and\n",
      "magically colored and outlined everything. The smoke of the guns\n",
      "mingled with this mist, and over the whole expanse and through that\n",
      "mist the rays of the morning sun were reflected, flashing back like\n",
      "lightning from the water, from the dew, and from the bayonets of the\n",
      "troops crowded together by the riverbanks and in Borodino. A white\n",
      "church could be seen through the mist, and here and there the roofs of\n",
      "huts in Borodino as well as dense masses of soldiers, or green\n",
      "ammunition chests and ordnance. And all this moved, or seemed to move,\n",
      "as the smoke and mist spread out over the whole space. Just as in\n",
      "the mist-enveloped hollow near Borodino, so along the entire line\n",
      "outside and above it and especially in the woods and fields to the\n",
      "left, in the valleys and on the summits of the high ground, clouds\n",
      "of powder smoke seemed continually to spring up out of nothing, now\n",
      "singly, now several at a time, some translucent, others dense,\n",

      "\n",

      "from violet into gray and milky white, and \"boom!\" came the report a\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Puff! puff!\"--and two clouds arose pushing one another and blending\n",

      "had seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pierre glanced round at the first cloud, which he had seen as a\n",

      "three and then four more appeared and then from each, with the same\n",
      "interval--\"boom--boom, boom!\" came the fine, firm, precise sounds in\n",
      "reply. It seemed as if those smoke clouds sometimes ran and\n",
      "sometimes stood still while woods, fields, and glittering bayonets ran\n",
      "past them. From the left, over fields and bushes, those large balls of\n",
      "smoke were continually appearing followed by their solemn reports,\n",
      "while nearer still, in the hollows and woods, there burst from the\n",
      "muskets small cloudlets that had no time to become balls, but had\n",
      "their little echoes in just the same way. \"Trakh-ta-ta-takh!\" came the\n",
      "frequent crackle of musketry, but it was irregular and feeble in\n",
      "comparison with the reports of the cannon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pierre wished to be there with that smoke, those shining bayonets,\n",
      "that movement, and those sounds. He turned to look at Kutuzov and\n",
      "his suite, to compare his impressions with those of others. They\n",
      "were all looking at the field of battle as he was, and, as it seemed\n",
      "to him, with the same feelings. All their faces were now shining\n",
      "with that latent warmth of feeling Pierre had noticed the day before\n",

      "pictures had been taken down. There were trunks in the rooms, and hay,\n",
      "wrapping paper, and ropes were scattered about. The peasants and house\n",

      "The voices and footsteps of the many servants and of the peasants\n",
      "who had come with the carts resounded as they shouted to one another\n",
      "in the yard and in the house. The count bad been out since morning.\n",
      "The countess had a headache brought on by all the noise and turmoil\n",
      "and was lying down in the new sitting room with a vinegar compress\n",
      "on her head. Petya was not at home, he had gone to visit a friend with\n",
      "whom he meant to obtain a transfer from the militia to the active\n",
      "army. Sonya was in the ballroom looking after the packing of the glass\n",

      "with dresses, ribbons, and scarves strewn all about her, gazing\n",
      "fixedly at the floor and holding in her hands the old ball dress\n",

      "except with all her heart and all her might. For a while she had stood\n",
      "beside Sonya while the china was being packed and tried to help, but\n",
      "soon gave it up and went to her room to pack her own things. At\n",
      "first she found it amusing to give away dresses and ribbons to the\n",
      "maids, but when that was done and what was left had still to be\n",

      "roused from her reverie by the talk of the maids in the next room\n",

      "servants ran noisily about the house and yard, shouting and disputing.\n",
      "Natasha, with the ardor characteristic of all she did suddenly set\n",
      "to work too. At first her intervention in the business of packing\n",
      "was received skeptically. Everybody expected some prank from her and\n",
      "did not wish to obey her; but she resolutely and passionately demanded\n",
      "obedience, grew angry and nearly cried because they did not heed\n",
      "her, and at last succeeded in making them believe her. Her first\n",
      "exploit, which cost her immense effort and established her\n",

      "Gobelin tapestries and Persian carpets in the house. When Natasha\n",
      "set to work two cases were standing open in the ballroom, one almost\n",
      "full up with crockery, the other with carpets. There was also much\n",
      "china standing on the tables, and still more was being brought in from\n",

      "But Natasha would not give in. She turned everything out and began\n",
      "quickly repacking, deciding that the inferior Russian carpets and\n",
      "unnecessary crockery should not be taken at all. When everything had\n",
      "been taken out of the cases, they recommenced packing, and it turned\n",
      "out that when the cheaper things not worth taking had nearly all\n",
      "been rejected, the valuable ones really did all go into the two cases.\n",
      "Only the lid of the case containing the carpets would not shut down. A\n",
      "few more things might have been taken out, but Natasha insisted on\n",
      "having her own way. She packed, repacked, pressed, made the butler's\n",

      "packing--press on the lid, and made desperate efforts herself.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I won't!\" cried Natasha, with one hand bolding back the hair that\n",

      "screamed with delight and tears fell from her eyes. But this only\n",
      "lasted a moment. She at once set to work afresh and they now trusted\n",
      "her completely. The count was not angry even when they told him that\n",
      "Natasha had countermanded an order of his, and the servants now came\n",
      "to her to ask whether a cart was sufficiently loaded, and whether it\n",
      "might be corded up. Thanks to Natasha's directions the work now went\n",
      "on expeditiously, unnecessary things were left, and the most\n",
      "valuable packed as compactly as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "But hard as they all worked till quite late that night, they could\n",

      "way from here, and there's nobody living in it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do us the honor to come in, there's plenty of everything in the\n",

      "Only two things indicated the social condition of Moscow--the\n",

      "whom some officials, seminarists, and gentry were mingled, had gone\n",
      "early that morning to the Three Hills. Having waited there for\n",
      "Rostopchin who did not turn up, they became convinced that Moscow\n",
      "would be surrendered, and then dispersed all about the town to the\n",
      "public houses and cookshops. Prices too that day indicated the state\n",
      "of affairs. The price of weapons, of gold, of carts and horses, kept\n",
      "rising, but the value of paper money and city articles kept falling,\n",
      "so that by midday there were instances of carters removing valuable\n",

      "the only indication was that three out of their huge retinue\n",
      "disappeared during the night, but nothing was stolen; and as to the\n",
      "value of their possessions, the thirty peasant carts that had come\n",
      "in from their estates and which many people envied proved to be\n",

      "agreeable post of assistant to the head of the staff of the\n",
      "assistant commander of the first division of the Second Army.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the first of September he had come to Moscow from the army.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had nothing to do in Moscow, but he had noticed that everyone\n",
      "in the army was asking for leave to visit Moscow and had something\n",
      "to do there. So he considered it necessary to ask for leave of absence\n",
      "for family and domestic reasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Berg drove up to his father-in-law's house in his spruce little trap\n",
      "with a pair of sleek roans, exactly like those of a certain prince. He\n",
      "looked attentively at the carts in the yard and while going up to\n",

      "is coming. But in general I can tell you, Papa, that such a heroic\n",
      "spirit, the truly antique valor of the Russian army, which they--which\n",
      "it\" (he corrected himself) \"has shown or displayed in the battle of\n",

      "you, Papa\" (he smote himself on the breast as a general he had heard\n",
      "speaking had done, but Berg did it a trifle late for he should have\n",
      "struck his breast at the words \"Russian army\"), \"I tell you frankly\n",
      "that we, the commanders, far from having to urge the men on or\n",
      "anything of that kind, could hardly restrain those... those... yes,\n",
      "those exploits of antique valor,\" he went on rapidly. \"General Barclay\n",

      "to some question.\n",

      "\"Altogether such heroism as was displayed by the Russian warriors\n",
      "cannot be imagined or adequately praised!\" said Berg, glancing round\n",

      "hand, asked about her health, and, swaying his head from side to\n",
      "side to express sympathy, remained standing beside her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, Mamma, I tell you sincerely that these are hard and sad\n",

      "\"I can't think what the servants are about,\" said the countess,\n",
      "turning to her husband. \"I have just been told that nothing is ready\n",

      "times. There won't be any end to it.\"\n",

      "The count was about to say something, but evidently restrained\n",

      "\n",
      "At that moment Berg drew out his handkerchief as if to blow his nose\n",

      "significantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And I have a great favor to ask of you, Papa,\" said he.\n",
      "\n",

      "there is a small chiffonier and a dressing table. You know how dear\n",
      "Vera wanted a chiffonier like that and how we had a dispute about it.\"\n",
      "(At the mention of the chiffonier and dressing table Berg\n",
      "involuntarily changed his tone to one of pleasure at his admirable\n",
      "domestic arrangements.) \"And it's such a beauty! It pulls out and\n",
      "has a secret English drawer, you know! And dear Vera has long wanted\n",
      "one. I wish to give her a surprise, you see. I saw so many of those\n",
      "peasant carts in your yard. Please let me have one, I will pay the man\n",

      "\n",

      "Petya was in the porch, engaged in giving out weapons to the\n",
      "servants who were to leave Moscow. The loaded carts were still\n",

      "\n",

      "steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's horrid! It's abominable!\" she screamed. \"You can't possibly\n",

      "Mamma, what does it matter what we take away? Only look what is\n",
      "going on in the yard... Mamma!... It's impossible!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The count stood by the window and listened without turning round.\n",
      "Suddenly he sniffed and put his face closer to the window.\n",
      "\n",
      "The countess glanced at her daughter, saw her face full of shame for\n",
      "her mother, saw her agitation, and understood why her husband did\n",
      "not turn to look at her now, and she glanced round quite disconcerted.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, do as you like! Am I hindering anyone?\" she said, not\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Mamma, darling, forgive me!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But the countess pushed her daughter away and went up to her\n",

      "\n",
      "\"My dear, you order what is right.... You know I don't understand\n",
      "about it,\" said she, dropping her eyes shamefacedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The eggs... the eggs are teaching the hen,\" muttered the count\n",
      "through tears of joy, and he embraced his wife who was glad to hide\n",
      "her look of shame on his breast.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Papa! Mamma! May I see to it? May I?...\" asked Natasha. \"We will\n",
      "still take all the most necessary things.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The count nodded affirmatively, and Natasha, at the rapid pace at\n",
      "which she used to run when playing at tag, ran through the ballroom to\n",

      "The servants gathered round Natasha, but could not believe the\n",
      "strange order she brought them until the count himself, in his\n",
      "wife's name, confirmed the order to give up all the carts to the\n",
      "wounded and take the trunks to the storerooms. When they understood\n",
      "that order the servants set to work at this new task with pleasure and\n",
      "zeal. It no longer seemed strange to them but on the contrary it\n",
      "seemed the only thing that could be done, just as a quarter of an hour\n",
      "before it had not seemed strange to anyone that the wounded should\n",
      "be left behind and the goods carted away but that had seemed the\n",
      "only thing to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "The whole household, as if to atone for not having done it sooner,\n",
      "set eagerly to work at the new task of placing the wounded in the\n",
      "carts. The wounded dragged themselves out of their rooms and stood\n",
      "with pale but happy faces round the carts. The news that carts were to\n",
      "be had spread to the neighboring houses, from which wounded men\n",
      "began to come into the Rostovs' yard. Many of the wounded asked them\n",
      "not to unload the carts but only to let them sit on the top of the\n",
      "things. But the work of unloading, once started, could not be\n",
      "arrested. It seemed not to matter whether all or only half the\n",
      "things were left behind. Cases full of china, bronzes, pictures, and\n",
      "mirrors that had been so carefully packed the night before now lay\n",
      "about the yard, and still they went on searching for and finding\n",
      "possibilities of unloading this or that and letting the wounded have\n",
      "another and yet another cart.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We can take four more men,\" said the steward. \"They can have my\n",

      "go with me in the carriage.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They unloaded the wardrobe cart and sent it to take wounded men from\n",
      "a house two doors off. The whole household, servants included, was\n",
      "bright and animated. Natasha was in a state of rapturous excitement\n",
      "such as she had not known for a long time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What could we fasten this onto?\" asked the servants, trying to\n",
      "fix a trunk on the narrow footboard behind a carriage. \"We must keep\n",
      "at least one cart.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's in it?\" asked Natasha.\n",
      "\n",

      "Natasha.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sonya too was busy all this time, but the aim of her efforts was\n",
      "quite different from Natasha's. She was putting away the things that\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Before two o'clock in the afternoon the Rostovs' four carriages,\n",
      "packed full and with the horses harnessed, stood at the front door.\n",
      "One by one the carts with the wounded had moved out of the yard.\n",
      "\n",
      "The caleche in which Prince Andrew was being taken attracted Sonya's\n",
      "attention as it passed the front porch. With the help of a maid she\n",
      "was arranging a seat for the countess in the huge high coach that\n",
      "stood at the entrance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Whose caleche is that?\" she inquired, leaning out of the carriage\n",
      "window.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, didn't you know, Miss?\" replied the maid. \"The wounded prince:\n",
      "he spent the night in our house and is going with us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But who is it? What's his name?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's our intended that was--Prince Bolkonski himself! They say he\n",
      "is dying,\" replied the maid with a sigh.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sonya jumped out of the coach and ran to the countess. The countess,\n",
      "tired out and already dressed in shawl and bonnet for her journey, was\n",
      "pacing up and down the drawing room, waiting for the household to\n",
      "assemble for the usual silent prayer with closed doors before\n",
      "starting. Natasha was not in the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mamma,\" said Sonya, \"Prince Andrew is here, mortally wounded. He is\n",
      "going with us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The countess opened her eyes in dismay and, seizing Sonya's arm,\n",
      "glanced around.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Natasha?\" she murmured.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that moment this news had only one significance for both of them.\n",
      "They knew their Natasha, and alarm as to what would happen if she\n",
      "heard this news stifled all sympathy for the man they both liked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Natasha does not know yet, but he is going with us,\" said Sonya.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You say he is dying?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sonya nodded.\n",
      "\n",
      "The countess put her arms around Sonya and began to cry.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The ways of God are past finding out!\" she thought, feeling that\n",
      "the Almighty Hand, hitherto unseen, was becoming manifest in all\n",
      "that was now taking place.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, Mamma? Everything is ready. What's the matter?\" asked\n",
      "Natasha, as with animated face she ran into the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing,\" answered the countess. \"If everything is ready let us\n",
      "start.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And the countess bent over her reticule to hide her agitated face.\n",
      "Sonya embraced Natasha and kissed her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Natasha looked at her inquiringly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is it? What has happened?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing... No...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is it something very bad for me? What is it?\" persisted Natasha\n",
      "with her quick intuition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sonya sighed and made no reply. The count, Petya, Madame Schoss,\n",
      "Mavra Kuzminichna, and Vasilich came into the drawing room and, having\n",
      "closed the doors, they all sat down and remained for some moments\n",
      "silently seated without looking at one another.\n",
      "\n",
      "The count was the first to rise, and with a loud sigh crossed\n",
      "himself before the icon. All the others did the same. Then the count\n",
      "embraced Mavra Kuzminichna and Vasilich, who were to remain in Moscow,\n",
      "and while they caught at his hand and kissed his shoulder he patted\n",
      "their backs lightly with some vaguely affectionate and comforting\n",
      "words. The countess went into the oratory and there Sonya found her on\n",
      "her knees before the icons that had been left here and there hanging\n",
      "on the wall. (The most precious ones, with which some family tradition\n",
      "was connected, were being taken with them.)\n",
      "\n",
      "In the porch and in the yard the men whom Petya had armed with\n",
      "swords and daggers, with trousers tucked inside their high boots and\n",
      "with belts and girdles tightened, were taking leave of those remaining\n",
      "behind.\n",
      "\n",
      "As is always the case at a departure, much had been forgotten or put\n",
      "in the wrong place, and for a long time two menservants stood one on\n",
      "each side of the open door and the carriage steps waiting to help\n",
      "the countess in, while maids rushed with cushions and bundles from the\n",
      "house to the carriages, the caleche, the phaeton, and back again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They always will forget everything!\" said the countess. \"Don't\n",
      "you know I can't sit like that?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And Dunyasha, with clenched teeth, without replying but with an\n",
      "aggrieved look on her face, hastily got into the coach to rearrange\n",
      "the seat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, those servants!\" said the count, swaying his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "Efim, the old coachman, who was the only one the countess trusted to\n",
      "drive her, sat perched up high on the box and did not so much as\n",
      "glance round at what was going on behind him. From thirty years'\n",
      "experience he knew it would be some time yet before the order, \"Be\n",
      "off, in God's name!\" would be given him: and he knew that even when it\n",
      "was said he would be stopped once or twice more while they sent back\n",
      "to fetch something that had been forgotten, and even after that he\n",
      "would again be stopped and the countess herself would lean out of\n",
      "the window and beg him for the love of heaven to drive carefully\n",
      "down the hill. He knew all this and therefore waited calmly for what\n",
      "would happen, with more patience than the horses, especially the\n",
      "near one, the chestnut Falcon, who was pawing the ground and\n",
      "champing his bit. At last all were seated, the carriage steps were\n",
      "folded and pulled up, the door was shut, somebody was sent for a\n",
      "traveling case, and the countess leaned out and said what she had to\n",
      "say. Then Efim deliberately doffed his hat and began crossing himself.\n",
      "The postilion and all the other servants did the same. \"Off, in\n",
      "God's name!\" said Efim, putting on his hat. \"Start!\" The postilion\n",
      "started the horses, the off pole horse tugged at his collar, the\n",
      "high springs creaked, and the body of the coach swayed. The footman\n",
      "sprang onto the box of the moving coach which jolted as it passed\n",
      "out of the yard onto the uneven roadway; the other vehicles jolted\n",
      "in their turn, and the procession of carriages moved up the street. In\n",
      "the carriages, the caleche, and the phaeton, all crossed themselves as\n",
      "they passed the church opposite the house. Those who were to remain in\n",
      "Moscow walked on either side of the vehicles seeing the travelers off.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rarely had Natasha experienced so joyful a feeling as now, sitting\n",
      "in the carriage beside the countess and gazing at the slowly\n",
      "receding walls of forsaken, agitated Moscow. Occasionally she leaned\n",
      "out of the carriage window and looked back and then forward at the\n",
      "long train of wounded in front of them. Almost at the head of the line\n",
      "she could see the raised hood of Prince Andrew's caleche. She did\n",
      "not know who was in it, but each time she looked at the procession her\n",
      "eyes sought that caleche. She knew it was right in front.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Kudrino, from the Nikitski, Presnya, and Podnovinsk Streets\n",
      "came several other trains of vehicles similar to the Rostovs', and\n",
      "as they passed along the Sadovaya Street the carriages and carts\n",
      "formed two rows abreast.\n",
      "\n",
      "As they were going round the Sukharev water tower Natasha, who was\n",
      "inquisitively and alertly scrutinizing the people driving or walking\n",
      "past, suddenly cried out in joyful surprise:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear me! Mamma, Sonya, look, it's he!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who? Who?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Look! Yes, on my word, it's Bezukhov!\" said Natasha, putting her\n",
      "head out of the carriage and staring at a tall, stout man in a\n",
      "coachman's long coat, who from his manner of walking and moving was\n",
      "evidently a gentleman in disguise, and who was passing under the\n",
      "arch of the Sukharev tower accompanied by a small, sallow-faced,\n",
      "beardless old man in a frieze coat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, it really is Bezukhov in a coachman's coat, with a\n",
      "queer-looking old boy. Really,\" said Natasha, \"look, look!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, it's not he. How can you talk such nonsense?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mamma,\" screamed Natasha, \"I'll stake my head it's he! I assure\n",
      "you! Stop, stop!\" she cried to the coachman.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the coachman could not stop, for from the Meshchanski Street\n",
      "came more carts and carriages, and the Rostovs were being shouted at\n",
      "to move on and not block the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, however, though now much farther off than before, the\n",
      "Rostovs all saw Pierre--or someone extraordinarily like him--in a\n",
      "coachman's coat, going down the street with head bent and a serious\n",
      "face beside a small, beardless old man who looked like a footman. That\n",
      "old man noticed a face thrust out of the carriage window gazing at\n",
      "them, and respectfully touching Pierre's elbow said something to him\n",
      "and pointed to the carriage. Pierre, evidently engrossed in thought,\n",
      "could not at first understand him. At length when he had understood\n",
      "and looked in the direction the old man indicated, he recognized\n",
      "Natasha, and following his first impulse stepped instantly and rapidly\n",
      "toward the coach. But having taken a dozen steps he seemed to remember\n",
      "something and stopped.\n",
      "\n",
      "Natasha's face, leaning out of the window, beamed with quizzical\n",
      "kindliness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Peter Kirilovich, come here! We have recognized you! This is\n",
      "wonderful!\" she cried, holding out her hand to him. \"What are you\n",
      "doing? Why are you like this?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Pierre took her outstretched hand and kissed it awkwardly as he\n",
      "walked along beside her while the coach still moved on.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is the matter, Count?\" asked the countess in a surprised and\n",
      "commiserating tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What? What? Why? Don't ask me,\" said Pierre, and looked round at\n",
      "Natasha whose radiant, happy expression--of which he was conscious\n",
      "without looking at her--filled him with enchantment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you remaining in Moscow, then?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Pierre hesitated.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In Moscow?\" he said in a questioning tone. \"Yes, in Moscow.\n",
      "Goodby!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, if only I were a man? I'd certainly stay with you. How\n",
      "splendid!\" said Natasha. \"Mamma, if you'll let me, I'll stay!\"\n",
      "\n",

      "For the last two days, ever since leaving home, Pierre had been\n",
      "living in the empty house of his deceased benefactor, Bazdeev. This is\n",
      "how it happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he woke up on the morning after his return to Moscow and his\n",
      "interview with Count Rostopchin, he could not for some time make out\n",
      "where he was and what was expected of him. When he was informed that\n",
      "among others awaiting him in his reception room there was a\n",
      "Frenchman who had brought a letter from his wife, the Countess Helene,\n",
      "he felt suddenly overcome by that sense of confusion and\n",
      "hopelessness to which he was apt to succumb. He felt that everything\n",
      "was now at an end, all was in confusion and crumbling to pieces,\n",
      "that nobody was right or wrong, the future held nothing, and there was\n",
      "no escape from this position. Smiling unnaturally and muttering to\n",
      "himself, he first sat down on the sofa in an attitude of despair, then\n",
      "rose, went to the door of the reception room and peeped through the\n",
      "crack, returned flourishing his arms, and took up a book. His\n",
      "major-domo came in a second time to say that the Frenchman who had\n",
      "brought the letter from the countess was very anxious to see him if\n",
      "only for a minute, and that someone from Bazdeev's widow had called to\n",
      "ask Pierre to take charge of her husband's books, as she herself was\n",

      "But as soon as the man had left the room Pierre took up his hat\n",
      "which was lying on the table and went out of his study by the other\n",
      "door. There was no one in the passage. He went along the whole\n",
      "length of this passage to the stairs and, frowning and rubbing his\n",
      "forehead with both hands, went down as far as the first landing. The\n",
      "hall porter was standing at the front door. From the landing where\n",
      "Pierre stood there was a second staircase leading to the back\n",
      "entrance. He went down that staircase and out into the yard. No one\n",
      "had seen him. But there were some carriages waiting, and as soon as\n",
      "Pierre stepped out of the gate the coachmen and the yard porter\n",
      "noticed him and raised their caps to him. When he felt he was being\n",
      "looked at he behaved like an ostrich which hides its head in a bush in\n",

      "\n",
      "Gerasim opened one of the shutters and left the room on tiptoe.\n",

      "manuscripts were kept, and took out what had once been one of the most\n",
      "important, the holy of holies of the order. This was the authentic\n",
      "Scotch Acts with Bazdeev's notes and explanations. He sat down at\n",
      "the dusty writing table, and, having laid the manuscripts before\n",
      "him, opened them out, closed them, finally pushed them away, and\n",
      "resting his head on his hand sank into meditation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gerasim looked cautiously into the study several times and saw\n",
      "Pierre always sitting in the same attitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "More than two hours passed and Gerasim took the liberty of making\n",
      "a slight noise at the door to attract his attention, but Pierre did\n",
      "not hear him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is the cabman to be discharged, your honor?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh yes!\" said Pierre, rousing himself and rising hurriedly. \"Look\n",
      "here,\" he added, taking Gerasim by a button of his coat and looking\n",
      "down at the old man with moist, shining, and ecstatic eyes, \"I say, do\n",

      "\n",
      "\"We heard so,\" replied the man.\n",

      "\"I beg you not to tell anyone who I am, and to do what I ask you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, your excellency,\" replied Gerasim. \"Will you have something to\n",
      "eat?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, but I want something else. I want peasant clothes and a\n",
      "pistol,\" said Pierre, unexpectedly blushing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, your excellency,\" said Gerasim after thinking for a moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "All the rest of that day Pierre spent alone in his benefactor's\n",
      "study, and Gerasim heard him pacing restlessly from one corner to\n",
      "another and talking to himself. And he spent the night on a bed made\n",
      "up for him there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gerasim, being a servant who in his time had seen many strange\n",
      "things, accepted Pierre's taking up his residence in the house without\n",
      "surprise, and seemed pleased to have someone to wait on. That same\n",
      "evening--without even asking himself what they were wanted for--he\n",
      "procured a coachman's coat and cap for Pierre, and promised to get him\n",
      "the pistol next day. Makar Alexeevich came twice that evening\n",
      "shuffling along in his galoshes as far as the door and stopped and\n",
      "looked ingratiatingly at Pierre. But as soon as Pierre turned toward\n",
      "him he wrapped his dressing gown around him with a shamefaced and\n",
      "angry look and hurried away. It was when Pierre (wearing the\n",
      "coachman's coat which Gerasim had procured for him and had disinfected\n",
      "by steam) was on his way with the old man to buy the pistol at the\n",

      "discordantly, arduously, and with great effort, evidently not\n",
      "because they wished to sing, but because they wanted to show they were\n",
      "drunk and on a spree. One, a tall, fair-haired lad in a clean blue\n",
      "coat, was standing over the others. His face with its fine straight\n",
      "nose would have been handsome had it not been for his thin,\n",
      "compressed, twitching lips and dull, gloomy, fixed eyes. Evidently\n",
      "possessed by some idea, he stood over those who were singing, and\n",
      "solemnly and jerkily flourished above their heads his white arm with\n",
      "the sleeve turned up to the elbow, trying unnaturally to spread out\n",
      "his dirty fingers. The sleeve of his coat kept slipping down and he\n",
      "always carefully rolled it up again with his left hand, as if it\n",
      "were most important that the sinewy white arm he was flourishing\n",
      "should be bare. In the midst of the song cries were heard, and\n",

      "\n",
      "On the evening of the first of September, after his interview with\n",
      "Kutuzov, Count Rostopchin had returned to Moscow mortified and\n",
      "offended because he had not been invited to attend the council of war,\n",
      "and because Kutuzov had paid no attention to his offer to take part in\n",
      "the defense of the city; amazed also at the novel outlook revealed\n",
      "to him at the camp, which treated the tranquillity of the capital\n",
      "and its patriotic fervor as not merely secondary but quite\n",
      "irrelevant and unimportant matters. Distressed, offended, and\n",
      "surprised by all this, Rostopchin had returned to Moscow. After supper\n",
      "he lay down on a sofa without undressing, and was awakened soon\n",
      "after midnight by a courier bringing him a letter from Kutuzov. This\n",
      "letter requested the count to send police officers to guide the troops\n",
      "through the town, as the army was retreating to the Ryazan road beyond\n",
      "Moscow. This was not news to Rostopchin. He had known that Moscow\n",
      "would be abandoned not merely since his interview the previous day\n",
      "with Kutuzov on the Poklonny Hill but ever since the battle of\n",
      "Borodino, for all the generals who came to Moscow after that battle\n",
      "had said unanimously that it was impossible to fight another battle,\n",
      "and since then the government property had been removed every night,\n",
      "and half the inhabitants had left the city with Rostopchin's own\n",
      "permission. Yet all the same this information astonished and irritated\n",
      "the count, coming as it did in the form of a simple note with an order\n",
      "from Kutuzov, and received at night, breaking in on his beauty sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "When later on in his memoirs Count Rostopchin explained his\n",
      "actions at this time, he repeatedly says that he was then actuated\n",
      "by two important considerations: to maintain tranquillity in Moscow\n",
      "and expedite the departure of the inhabitants. If one accepts this\n",
      "twofold aim all Rostopchin's actions appear irreproachable. \"Why\n",
      "were the holy relics, the arms, ammunition, gunpowder, and stores of\n",
      "corn not removed? Why were thousands of inhabitants deceived into\n",
      "believing that Moscow would not be given up--and thereby ruined?\"\n",
      "\"To presence the tranquillity of the city,\" explains Count Rostopchin.\n",
      "\"Why were bundles of useless papers from the government offices, and\n",
      "Leppich's balloon and other articles removed?\" \"To leave the town\n",
      "empty,\" explains Count Rostopchin. One need only admit that public\n",
      "tranquillity is in danger and any action finds a justification.\n",
      "\n",
      "All the horrors of the reign of terror were based only on solicitude\n",
      "for public tranquillity.\n",
      "\n",
      "On what, then, was Count Rostopchin's fear for the tranquillity of\n",
      "Moscow based in 1812? What reason was there for assuming any\n",
      "probability of an uprising in the city? The inhabitants were leaving\n",
      "it and the retreating troops were filling it. Why should that cause\n",
      "the masses to riot?\n",
      "\n",
      "Neither in Moscow nor anywhere in Russia did anything resembling\n",
      "an insurrection ever occur when the enemy entered a town. More than\n",
      "ten thousand people were still in Moscow on the first and second of\n",
      "September, and except for a mob in the governor's courtyard, assembled\n",
      "there at his bidding, nothing happened. It is obvious that there would\n",
      "have been even less reason to expect a disturbance among the people if\n",
      "after the battle of Borodino, when the surrender of Moscow became\n",
      "certain or at least probable, Rostopchin instead of exciting the\n",
      "people by distributing arms and broadsheets had taken steps to\n",
      "remove all the holy relics, the gunpowder, munitions, and money, and\n",
      "had told the population plainly that the town would be abandoned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rostopchin, though he had patriotic sentiments, was a sanguine and\n",
      "impulsive man who had always moved in the highest administrative\n",
      "circles and had no understanding at all of the people he supposed\n",
      "himself to be guiding. Ever since the enemy's entry into Smolensk he\n",
      "had in imagination been playing the role of director of the popular\n",
      "feeling of \"the heart of Russia.\" Not only did it seem to him (as to\n",
      "all administrators) that he controlled the external actions of\n",
      "Moscow's inhabitants, but he also thought he controlled their mental\n",
      "attitude by means of his broadsheets and posters, written in a\n",
      "coarse tone which the people despise in their own class and do not\n",
      "understand from those in authority. Rostopchin was so pleased with the\n",
      "fine role of leader of popular feeling, and had grown so used to it,\n",
      "that the necessity of relinquishing that role and abandoning Moscow\n",
      "without any heroic display took him unawares and he suddenly felt\n",
      "the ground slip away from under his feet, so that he positively did\n",
      "not know what to do. Though he knew it was coming, he did not till the\n",
      "last moment wholeheartedly believe that Moscow would be abandoned, and\n",
      "did not prepare for it. The inhabitants left against his wishes. If\n",
      "the government offices were removed, this was only done on the\n",
      "demand of officials to whom the count yielded reluctantly. He was\n",
      "absorbed in the role he had created for himself. As is often the\n",
      "case with those gifted with an ardent imagination, though he had\n",
      "long known that Moscow would be abandoned he knew it only with his\n",
      "intellect, he did not believe it in his heart and did not adapt\n",
      "himself mentally to this new position of affairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "All his painstaking and energetic activity (in how far it was useful\n",
      "and had any effect on the people is another question) had been\n",
      "simply directed toward arousing in the masses his own feeling of\n",
      "patriotic hatred of the French.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when events assumed their true historical character, when\n",
      "expressing hatred for the French in words proved insufficient, when it\n",
      "was not even possible to express that hatred by fighting a battle,\n",
      "when self-confidence was of no avail in relation to the one question\n",
      "before Moscow, when the whole population streamed out of Moscow as one\n",
      "man, abandoning their belongings and proving by that negative action\n",
      "all the depth of their national feeling, then the role chosen by\n",
      "Rostopchin suddenly appeared senseless. He unexpectedly felt himself\n",
      "ridiculous, weak, and alone, with no ground to stand on.\n",
      "\n",
      "When, awakened from his sleep, he received that cold, peremptory\n",
      "note from Kutuzov, he felt the more irritated the more he felt himself\n",
      "to blame. All that he had been specially put in charge of, the state\n",
      "property which he should have removed, was still in Moscow and it\n",
      "was no longer possible to take the whole of it away.\n",
      "\n",

      "Traitors!\" he thought, without clearly defining who the villains and\n",
      "traitors were, but feeling it necessary to hate those traitors whoever\n",

      "ruin of Moscow. Wait for me!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And the count stepped as briskly back into the room and slammed\n",
      "the door behind him.\n",
      "\n",
      "A murmur of approbation and satisfaction ran through the crowd.\n",
      "\"He'll settle with all the villains, you'll see! And you said the\n",
      "French... He'll show you what law is!\" the mob were saying as if\n",
      "reproving one another for their lack of confidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few minutes later an officer came hurriedly out of the front door,\n",
      "gave an order, and the dragoons formed up in line. The crowd moved\n",
      "eagerly from the balcony toward the porch. Rostopchin, coming out\n",
      "there with quick angry steps, looked hastily around as if seeking\n",
      "someone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where is he?\" he inquired. And as he spoke he saw a young man\n",
      "coming round the corner of the house between two dragoons. He had a\n",
      "long thin neck, and his head, that had been half shaved, was again\n",
      "covered by short hair. This young man was dressed in a threadbare blue\n",
      "cloth coat lined with fox fur, that had once been smart, and dirty\n",
      "hempen convict trousers, over which were pulled his thin, dirty,\n",
      "trodden-down boots. On his thin, weak legs were heavy chains which\n",
      "hampered his irresolute movements.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah!\" said Rostopchin, hurriedly turning away his eyes from the\n",
      "young man in the fur-lined coat and pointing to the bottom step of the\n",
      "porch. \"Put him there.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The young man in his clattering chains stepped clumsily to the\n",
      "spot indicated, holding away with one finger the coat collar which\n",
      "chafed his neck, turned his long neck twice this way and that, sighed,\n",
      "and submissively folded before him his thin hands, unused to work.\n",
      "\n",
      "For several seconds while the young man was taking his place on\n",
      "the step the silence continued. Only among the back rows of the\n",
      "people, who were all pressing toward the one spot, could sighs,\n",
      "groans, and the shuffling of feet be heard.\n",
      "\n",
      "While waiting for the young man to take his place on the step\n",
      "Rostopchin stood frowning and rubbing his face with his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lads!\" said he, with a metallic ring in his voice. \"This man,\n",
      "Vereshchagin, is the scoundrel by whose doing Moscow is perishing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The young man in the fur-lined coat, stooping a little, stood in a\n",
      "submissive attitude, his fingers clasped before him. His emaciated\n",
      "young face, disfigured by the half-shaven head, hung down\n",
      "hopelessly. At the count's first words he raised it slowly and\n",
      "looked up at him as if wishing to say something or at least to meet\n",
      "his eye. But Rostopchin did not look at him. A vein in the young man's\n",
      "long thin neck swelled like a cord and went blue behind the ear, and\n",
      "suddenly his face flushed.\n",
      "\n",
      "All eyes were fixed on him. He looked at the crowd, and rendered\n",
      "more hopeful by the expression he read on the faces there, he smiled\n",
      "sadly and timidly, and lowering his head shifted his feet on the step.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He has betrayed his Tsar and his country, he had gone over to\n",
      "Bonaparte. He alone of all the Russians has disgraced the Russian\n",
      "name, he has caused Moscow to perish,\" said Rostopchin in a sharp,\n",
      "even voice, but suddenly he glanced down at Vereshchagin who continued\n",
      "to stand in the same submissive attitude. As if inflamed by the sight,\n",
      "he raised his arm and addressed the people, almost shouting:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Deal with him as you think fit! I hand him over to you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The crowd remained silent and only pressed closer and closer to\n",
      "one another. To keep one another back, to breathe in that stifling\n",
      "atmosphere, to be unable to stir, and to await something unknown,\n",
      "uncomprehended, and terrible, was becoming unbearable. Those\n",
      "standing in front, who had seen and heard what had taken place\n",
      "before them, all stood with wide open eyes and mouths, straining\n",
      "with all their strength, and held back the crowd that was pushing\n",
      "behind them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Beat him!... Let the traitor perish and not disgrace the Russian\n",
      "name!\" shouted Rostopchin. \"Cut him down. I command it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hearing not so much the words as the angry tone of Rostopchin's\n",
      "voice, the crowd moaned and heaved forward, but again paused.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Count!\" exclaimed the timid yet theatrical voice of Vereshchagin in\n",
      "the midst of the momentary silence that ensued, \"Count! One God is\n",
      "above us both....\" He lifted his head and again the thick vein in\n",
      "his thin neck filled with blood and the color rapidly came and went in\n",
      "his face.\n",
      "\n",
      "He did not finish what he wished to say.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Cut him down! I command it...\" shouted Rostopchin, suddenly growing\n",
      "pale like Vereshchagin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Draw sabers!\" cried the dragoon officer, drawing his own.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another still stronger wave flowed through the crowd and reaching\n",
      "the front ranks carried it swaying to the very steps of the porch. The\n",
      "tall youth, with a stony look on his face, and rigid and uplifted arm,\n",
      "stood beside Vereshchagin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Saber him!\" the dragoon officer almost whispered.\n",
      "\n",
      "And one of the soldiers, his face all at once distorted with fury,\n",
      "struck Vereshchagin on the head with the blunt side of his saber.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah!\" cried Vereshchagin in meek surprise, looking round with a\n",
      "frightened glance as if not understanding why this was done to him.\n",
      "A similar moan of surprise and horror ran through the crowd. \"O Lord!\"\n",
      "exclaimed a sorrowful voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "But after the exclamation of surprise that had escaped from\n",
      "Vereshchagin he uttered a plaintive cry of pain, and that cry was\n",
      "fatal. The barrier of human feeling, strained to the utmost, that\n",
      "had held the crowd in check suddenly broke. The crime had begun and\n",
      "must now be completed. The plaintive moan of reproach was drowned by\n",
      "the threatening and angry roar of the crowd. Like the seventh and last\n",
      "wave that shatters a ship, that last irresistible wave burst from\n",
      "the rear and reached the front ranks, carrying them off their feet and\n",
      "engulfing them all. The dragoon was about to repeat his blow.\n",
      "Vereshchagin with a cry of horror, covering his head with his hands,\n",
      "rushed toward the crowd. The tall youth, against whom he stumbled,\n",
      "seized his thin neck with his hands and, yelling wildly, fell with him\n",
      "under the feet of the pressing, struggling crowd.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some beat and tore at Vereshchagin, others at the tall youth. And\n",
      "the screams of those that were being trampled on and of those who\n",
      "tried to rescue the tall lad only increased the fury of the crowd.\n",
      "It was a long time before the dragoons could extricate the bleeding\n",
      "youth, beaten almost to death. And for a long time, despite the\n",
      "feverish haste with which the mob tried to end the work that had\n",
      "been begun, those who were hitting, throttling, and tearing at\n",
      "Vereshchagin were unable to kill him, for the crowd pressed from all\n",

      "\n",
      "Only when the victim ceased to struggle and his cries changed to a\n",

      "prostrate, bleeding corpse begin rapidly to change places. Each one\n",
      "came up, glanced at what had been done, and with horror, reproach, and\n",
      "astonishment pushed back again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"O Lord! The people are like wild beasts! How could he be alive?\"\n",
      "voices in the crowd could be heard saying. \"Quite a young fellow\n",

      "not the right one.... How not the right one?... O Lord! And there's\n",
      "another has been beaten too--they say he's nearly done for.... Oh, the\n",
      "people... Aren't they afraid of sinning?...\" said the same mob now,\n",

      "\n",
      "A painstaking police officer, considering the presence of a corpse\n",
      "in his excellency's courtyard unseemly, told the dragoons to take it\n",
      "away. Two dragoons took it by its distorted legs and dragged it\n",
      "along the ground. The gory, dust-stained, half-shaven head with its\n",

      "from it.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the moment when Vereshchagin fell and the crowd closed in with\n",
      "savage yells and swayed about him, Rostopchin suddenly turned pale\n",
      "and, instead of going to the back entrance where his carriage\n",
      "awaited him, went with hurried steps and bent head, not knowing\n",
      "where and why, along the passage leading to the rooms on the ground\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This way, your excellency... Where are you going?... This way,\n",

      "\n",
      "When they reached the Myasnitski Street and could no longer hear the\n",
      "shouts of the mob, the count began to repent. He remembered with\n",
      "dissatisfaction the agitation and fear he had betrayed before his\n",
      "subordinates. \"The mob is terrible--disgusting,\" he said to himself in\n",
      "French. \"They are like wolves whom nothing but flesh can appease.\"\n",
      "\"Count! One God is above us both!\"--Vereshchagin's words suddenly\n",
      "recurred to him, and a disagreeable shiver ran down his back. But this\n",
      "was only a momentary feeling and Count Rostopchin smiled\n",
      "disdainfully at himself. \"I had other duties,\" thought he. \"The people\n",
      "had to be appeased. Many other victims have perished and are perishing\n",
      "for the public good\"--and he began thinking of his social duties to\n",
      "his family and to the city entrusted to him, and of himself--not\n",
      "himself as Theodore Vasilyevich Rostopchin (he fancied that Theodore\n",
      "Vasilyevich Rostopchin was sacrificing himself for the public good)\n",
      "but himself as governor, the representative of authority and of the\n",
      "Tsar. \"Had I been simply Theodore Vasilyevich my course of action\n",

      "\n",
      "Lightly swaying on the flexible springs of his carriage and no\n",
      "longer hearing the terrible sounds of the crowd, Rostopchin grew\n",
      "physically calm and, as always happens, as soon as he became\n",
      "physically tranquil his mind devised reasons why he should be mentally\n",
      "tranquil too. The thought which tranquillized Rostopchin was not a new\n",
      "one. Since the world began and men have killed one another no one\n",
      "has ever committed such a crime against his fellow man without\n",
      "comforting himself with this same idea. This idea is le bien public,\n",

      "\n",
      "To a man not swayed by passion that welfare is never certain, but he\n",
      "who commits such a crime always knows just where that welfare lies.\n",
      "And Rostopchin now knew it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not only did his reason not reproach him for what he had done, but\n",
      "he even found cause for self-satisfaction in having so successfully\n",
      "contrived to avail himself of a convenient opportunity to punish a\n",
      "criminal and at the same time pacify the mob.\n",
      "\n",

      "Half an hour later he was driving with his fast horses across the\n",
      "Sokolniki field, no longer thinking of what had occurred but\n",
      "considering what was to come. He was driving to the Yauza bridge where\n",
      "he had heard that Kutuzov was. Count Rostopchin was mentally preparing\n",
      "the angry and stinging reproaches he meant to address to Kutuzov for\n",
      "his deception. He would make that foxy old courtier feel that the\n",
      "responsibility for all the calamities that would follow the\n",
      "abandonment of the city and the ruin of Russia (as Rostopchin regarded\n",
      "it) would fall upon his doting old head. Planning beforehand what he\n",

      "\n",
      "The Sokolniki field was deserted. Only at the end of it, in front of\n",
      "the almshouse and the lunatic asylum, could be seen some people in\n",
      "white and others like them walking singly across the field shouting\n",
      "and gesticulating.\n",

      "One of these was running to cross the path of Count Rostopchin's\n",

      "him to stop. The lunatic's solemn, gloomy face was thin and yellow,\n",
      "with its beard growing in uneven tufts. His black, agate pupils with\n",
      "saffron-yellow whites moved restlessly near the lower eyelids.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stop! Pull up, I tell you!\" he cried in a piercing voice, and again\n",

      "the ground as fast as the horses could draw it, but for a long time\n",
      "Count Rostopchin still heard the insane despairing screams growing\n",
      "fainter in the distance, while his eyes saw nothing but the\n",

      "fur-lined coat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recent as that mental picture was, Rostopchin already felt that it\n",
      "had cut deep into his heart and drawn blood. Even now he felt\n",
      "clearly that the gory trace of that recollection would not pass with\n",
      "time, but that the terrible memory would, on the contrary, dwell in\n",
      "his heart ever more cruelly and painfully to the end of his life. He\n",

      "\"Why did I utter those words? It was by some accident I said\n",

      "whip in the sand when a caleche dashed up noisily. A man in a\n",
      "general's uniform with plumes in his hat went up to Kutuzov and said\n",
      "something in French. It was Count Rostopchin. He told Kutuzov that\n",

      "\n",
      "During the two days that elapsed before Rostov called, Princess Mary\n",
      "continually thought of how she ought to behave to him. First she\n",

      "she told herself that only she, with her sinful nature, could think\n",
      "this of them: they could not forget that situated as she was, while\n",
      "still wearing deep mourning, such matchmaking would be an insult to\n",
      "her and to her father's memory. Assuming that she did go down to see\n",
      "him, Princess Mary imagined the words he would say to her and what she\n",
      "would say to him, and these words sometimes seemed undeservedly cold\n",
      "and then to mean too much. More than anything she feared lest the\n",

      "saw him.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when on Sunday after church the footman announced in the drawing\n",

      "\n",
      "When Rostov entered the room, the princess dropped her eyes for an\n",
      "instant, as if to give the visitor time to greet her aunt, and then\n",
      "just as Nicholas turned to her she raised her head and met his look\n",
      "with shining eyes. With a movement full of dignity and grace she\n",
      "half rose with a smile of pleasure, held out her slender, delicate\n",
      "hand to him, and began to speak in a voice in which for the first time\n",
      "new deep womanly notes vibrated. Mademoiselle Bourienne, who was in\n",
      "the drawing room, looked at Princess Mary in bewildered surprise.\n",
      "Herself a consummate coquette, she could not have maneuvered better on\n",

      "Had Princess Mary been capable of reflection at that moment, she\n",
      "would have been more surprised than Mademoiselle Bourienne at the\n",
      "change that had taken place in herself. From the moment she recognized\n",
      "that dear, loved face, a new life force took possession of her and\n",
      "compelled her to speak and act apart from her own will. From the\n",
      "time Rostov entered, her face became suddenly transformed. It was as\n",
      "if a light had been kindled in a carved and painted lantern and the\n",
      "intricate, skillful, artistic work on its sides, that previously\n",
      "seemed dark, coarse, and meaningless, was suddenly shown up in\n",
      "unexpected and striking beauty. For the first time all that pure,\n",
      "spiritual, inward travail through which she had lived appeared on\n",
      "the surface. All her inward labor, her dissatisfaction with herself,\n",
      "her sufferings, her strivings after goodness, her meekness, love,\n",
      "and self-sacrifice--all this now shone in those radiant eyes, in her\n",

      "\n",
      "Their conversation was very simple and unimportant. They spoke of\n",
      "the war, and like everyone else unconsciously exaggerated their sorrow\n",
      "about it; they spoke of their last meeting--Nicholas trying to\n",

      "Russia's misfortunes with a certain artificiality, but her brother was\n",
      "too near her heart and she neither could nor would speak lightly of\n",
      "him. Nicholas noticed this, as he noticed every shade of Princess\n",
      "Mary's character with an observation unusual to him, and everything\n",
      "confirmed his conviction that she was a quite unusual and\n",
      "extraordinary being. Nicholas blushed and was confused when people\n",
      "spoke to him about the princess (as she did when he was mentioned) and\n",
      "even when he thought of her, but in her presence he felt quite at\n",
      "ease, and said not at all what he had prepared, but what, quite\n",
      "appropriately, occurred to him at the moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "When a pause occurred during his short visit, Nicholas, as is\n",
      "usual when there are children, turned to Prince Andrew's little son,\n",
      "caressing him and asking whether he would like to be an hussar. He\n",
      "took the boy on his knee, played with him, and looked round at\n",
      "Princess Mary. With a softened, happy, timid look she watched the\n",
      "boy she loved in the arms of the man she loved. Nicholas also\n",
      "noticed that look and, as if understanding it, flushed with pleasure\n",
      "and began to kiss the boy with good natured playfulness.\n",

      "himself now to the force of circumstances and to those who were\n",

      "the desire for vengeance, or any feeling of that kind, but\n",
      "everything in Voronezh suddenly seemed to him dull and tiresome, and\n",
      "he experienced an indefinite feeling of shame and awkwardness. The\n",
      "conversations he heard seemed to him insincere; he did not know how to\n",
      "judge all these affairs and felt that only in the regiment would\n",
      "everything again become clear to him. He made haste to finish buying\n",
      "the horses, and often became unreasonably angry with his servant and\n",
      "squadron quartermaster.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few days before his departure a special thanksgiving, at which\n",
      "Nicholas was present, was held in the cathedral for the Russian\n",
      "victory. He stood a little behind the governor and held himself with\n",
      "military decorum through the service, meditating on a great variety of\n",

      "Nicholas immediately recognized Princess Mary not so much by the\n",
      "profile he saw under her bonnet as by the feeling of solicitude,\n",
      "timidity, and pity that immediately overcame him. Princess Mary,\n",

      "inner, spiritual labor, but now it was quite differently lit up. There\n",
      "was a pathetic expression of sorrow, prayer, and hope in it. As had\n",

      "without waiting to be prompted by the governor's wife and not asking\n",
      "himself whether or not it was right and proper to address her here\n",
      "in church, and told her he had heard of her trouble and sympathized\n",

      "said it was a shell) \"either proving fatal at once or being very\n",

      "him gratefully, went out, following her aunt.\n",
      "\n",
      "That evening Nicholas did not go out, but stayed at home to settle\n",
      "some accounts with the horse dealers. When he had finished that\n",
      "business it was already too late to go anywhere but still too early to\n",
      "go to bed, and for a long time he paced up and down the room,\n",

      "\n",
      "Princess Mary had made an agreeable impression on him when he had\n",

      "exceptional circumstances, and his mother having at one time mentioned\n",
      "her to him as a good match, had drawn his particular attention to her.\n",
      "When he met her again in Voronezh the impression she made on him was\n",
      "not merely pleasing but powerful. Nicholas had been struck by the\n",
      "peculiar moral beauty he observed in her at this time. He was,\n",
      "however, preparing to go away and it had not entered his head to\n",
      "regret that he was thus depriving himself of chances of meeting her.\n",
      "But that day's encounter in church had, he felt, sunk deeper than\n",
      "was desirable for his peace of mind. That pale, sad, refined face,\n",
      "that radiant look, those gentle graceful gestures, and especially\n",
      "the deep and tender sorrow expressed in all her features agitated\n",
      "him and evoked his sympathy. In men Rostov could not bear to see the\n",
      "expression of a higher spiritual life (that was why he did not like\n",
      "Prince Andrew) and he referred to it contemptuously as philosophy\n",
      "and dreaminess, but in Princess Mary that very sorrow which revealed\n",
      "the depth of a whole spiritual world foreign to him was an\n",
      "irresistible attraction.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She must be a wonderful woman. A real angel!\" he said to himself.\n",
      "\"Why am I not free? Why was I in such a hurry with Sonya?\" And he\n",
      "involuntarily compared the two: the lack of spirituality in the one\n",
      "and the abundance of it in the other--a spirituality he himself lacked\n",
      "and therefore valued most highly. He tried to picture what would\n",
      "happen were he free. How he would propose to her and how she would\n",
      "become his wife. But no, he could not imagine that. He felt awed,\n",
      "and no clear picture presented itself to his mind. He had long ago\n",
      "pictured to himself a future with Sonya, and that was all clear and\n",
      "simple just because it had all been thought out and he knew all\n",
      "there was in Sonya, but it was impossible to picture a future with\n",
      "Princess Mary, because he did not understand her but simply loved her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reveries about Sonya had had something merry and playful in them,\n",
      "but to dream of Princess Mary was always difficult and a little\n",
      "frightening.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How she prayed!\" he thought. \"It was plain that her whole soul\n",
      "was in her prayer. Yes, that was the prayer that moves mountains,\n",
      "and I am sure her prayer will be answered. Why don't I pray for what I\n",
      "want?\" he suddenly thought. \"What do I want? To be free, released from\n",
      "Sonya... She was right,\" he thought, remembering what the governor's\n",
      "wife had said: \"Nothing but misfortune can come of marrying Sonya.\n",
      "Muddles, grief for Mamma... business difficulties... muddles, terrible\n",
      "muddles! Besides, I don't love her--not as I should. O, God! release\n",
      "me from this dreadful, inextricable position!\" he suddenly began to\n",
      "pray. \"Yes, prayer can move mountains, but one must have faith and not\n",
      "pray as Natasha and I used to as children, that the snow might turn\n",
      "into sugar--and then run out into the yard to see whether it had\n",
      "done so. No, but I am not praying for trifles now,\" he thought as he\n",
      "put his pipe down in a corner, and folding his hands placed himself\n",
      "before the icon. Softened by memories of Princess Mary he began to\n",
      "pray as he had not done for a long time. Tears were in his eyes and in\n",
      "his throat when the door opened and Lavrushka came in with some\n",
      "papers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Blockhead! Why do you come in without being called?\" cried\n",
      "Nicholas, quickly changing his attitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"From the governor,\" said Lavrushka in a sleepy voice. \"A courier\n",

      "and his eyes opened wide with fear and joy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, it's not possible!\" he cried aloud.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unable to sit still he paced up and down the room holding the letter\n",
      "and reading it. He glanced through it, then read it again, and then\n",
      "again, and standing still in the middle of the room he raised his\n",
      "shoulders, stretching out his hands, with his mouth wide open and\n",
      "his eyes fixed. What he had just been praying for with confidence that\n",
      "God would hear him had come to pass; but Nicholas was as much\n",
      "astonished as if it were something extraordinary and unexpected, and\n",
      "as if the very fact that it had happened so quickly proved that it had\n",
      "not come from God to whom he had prayed, but by some ordinary\n",
      "coincidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "This unexpected and, as it seemed to Nicholas, quite voluntary\n",
      "letter from Sonya freed him from the knot that fettered him and from\n",
      "which there had seemed no escape. She wrote that the last\n",
      "unfortunate events--the loss of almost the whole of the Rostovs'\n",
      "Moscow property--and the countess' repeatedly expressed wish that\n",
      "Nicholas should marry Princess Bolkonskaya, together with his\n",

      "countess also mentioned that Prince Andrew was among the wounded\n",

      "countess in vague general terms, avoided talking with her and resolved\n",
      "to wait till she should see Nicholas, not in order to set him free but\n",
      "on the contrary at that meeting to bind him to her forever.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bustle and terror of the Rostovs' last days in Moscow stifled\n",
      "the gloomy thoughts that oppressed Sonya. She was glad to find\n",
      "escape from them in practical activity. But when she heard of Prince\n",
      "Andrew's presence in their house, despite her sincere pity for him and\n",
      "for Natasha, she was seized by a joyful and superstitious feeling that\n",
      "God did not intend her to be separated from Nicholas. She knew that\n",
      "Natasha loved no one but Prince Andrew and had never ceased to love\n",
      "him. She knew that being thrown together again under such terrible\n",
      "circumstances they would again fall in love with one another, and that\n",
      "Nicholas would then not be able to marry Princess Mary as they would\n",
      "be within the prohibited degrees of affinity. Despite all the terror\n",
      "of what had happened during those last days and during the first\n",
      "days of their journey, this feeling that Providence was intervening in\n",
      "her personal affairs cheered Sonya.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the Troitsa monastery the Rostovs first broke their journey for a\n",
      "whole day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three large rooms were assigned to them in the monastery hostelry,\n",
      "one of which was occupied by Prince Andrew. The wounded man was much\n",
      "better that day and Natasha was sitting with him. In the next room sat\n",
      "the count and countess respectfully conversing with the prior, who was\n",
      "calling on them as old acquaintances and benefactors of the monastery.\n",
      "Sonya was there too, tormented by curiosity as to what Prince Andrew\n",
      "and Natasha were talking about. She heard the sound of their voices\n",
      "through the door. That door opened and Natasha came out, looking\n",
      "excited. Not noticing the monk, who had risen to greet her and was\n",
      "drawing back the wide sleeve on his right arm, she went up to Sonya\n",
      "and took her hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Natasha, what are you about? Come here!\" said the countess.\n",
      "\n",
      "Natasha went up to the monk for his blessing, and advised her to\n",
      "pray for aid to God and His saint.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sonya was not less agitated than her friend by the latter's fear and\n",
      "grief and by her own personal feelings which she shared with no one.\n",
      "Sobbing, she kissed and comforted Natasha. \"If only he lives!\" she\n",
      "thought. Having wept, talked, and wiped away their tears, the two\n",
      "friends went together to Prince Andrew's door. Natasha opened it\n",
      "cautiously and glanced into the room, Sonya standing beside her at the\n",
      "half-open door.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prince Andrew was lying raised high on three pillows. His pale\n",
      "face was calm, his eyes closed, and they could see his regular\n",
      "breathing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"O, Natasha!\" Sonya suddenly almost screamed, catching her\n",
      "companion's arm and stepping back from the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What? What is it?\" asked Natasha.\n",
      "\n",

      "not yet understanding what the latter was telling her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You remember,\" said Sonya with a solemn and frightened\n",
      "expression. \"You remember when I looked in the mirror for you... at\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Yes, yes!\" cried Natasha opening her eyes wide, and vaguely\n",
      "recalling that Sonya had told her something about Prince Andrew whom\n",
      "she had seen lying down.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You remember?\" Sonya went on. \"I saw it then and told everybody,\n",
      "you and Dunyasha. I saw him lying on a bed,\" said she, making a\n",
      "gesture with her hand and a lifted finger at each detail, \"and that he\n",
      "had his eyes closed and was covered just with a pink quilt, and that\n",
      "his hands were folded,\" she concluded, convincing herself that the\n",
      "details she had just seen were exactly what she had seen in the\n",
      "mirror.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had in fact seen nothing then but had mentioned the first\n",
      "thing that came into her head, but what she had invented then seemed\n",
      "to her now as real as any other recollection. She not only\n",
      "remembered what she had then said--that he turned to look at her and\n",
      "smiled and was covered with something red--but was firmly convinced\n",
      "that she had then seen and said that he was covered with a pink\n",
      "quilt and that his eyes were closed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, yes, it really was pink!\" cried Natasha, who now thought she\n",
      "too remembered the word pink being used, and saw in this the most\n",
      "extraordinary and mysterious part of the prediction.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But what does it mean?\" she added meditatively.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I don't know, it is all so strange,\" replied Sonya, clutching\n",
      "at her head.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few minutes later Prince Andrew rang and Natasha went to him,\n",
      "but Sonya, feeling unusually excited and touched, remained at the\n",

      "They had an opportunity that day to send letters to the army, and\n",
      "the countess was writing to her son.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sonya!\" said the countess, raising her eyes from her letter as\n",
      "her niece passed, \"Sonya, won't you write to Nicholas?\" She spoke in a\n",
      "soft, tremulous voice, and in the weary eyes that looked over her\n",
      "spectacles Sonya read all that the countess meant to convey with these\n",
      "words. Those eyes expressed entreaty, shame at having to ask, fear\n",
      "of a refusal, and readiness for relentless hatred in case of such\n",
      "refusal.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sonya was softened, excited, and touched by all that had occurred\n",
      "that day, especially by the mysterious fulfillment she had just seen\n",
      "of her vision. Now that she knew that the renewal of Natasha's\n",
      "relations with Prince Andrew would prevent Nicholas from marrying\n",
      "Princess Mary, she was joyfully conscious of a return of that\n",
      "self-sacrificing spirit in which she was accustomed to live and\n",
      "loved to live. So with a joyful consciousness of performing a\n",
      "magnanimous deed--interrupted several times by the tears that dimmed\n",
      "her velvety black eyes--she wrote that touching letter the arrival\n",
      "of which had so amazed Nicholas.\n",
      "CHAPTER IX\n",
      "The officer and soldiers who had arrested Pierre treated him with\n",
      "hostility but yet with respect, in the guardhouse to which he was\n",
      "taken. In their attitude toward him could still be felt both\n",
      "uncertainty as to who he might be--perhaps a very important person-\n",
      "and hostility as a result of their recent personal conflict with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when the guard was relieved next morning, Pierre felt that for\n",
      "the new guard--both officers and men--he was not as interesting as\n",
      "he had been to his captors; and in fact the guard of the second day\n",
      "did not recognize in this big, stout man in a peasant coat the\n",
      "vigorous person who had fought so desperately with the marauder and\n",
      "the convoy and had uttered those solemn words about saving a child;\n",
      "they saw in him only No. 17 of the captured Russians, arrested and\n",
      "detained for some reason by order of the Higher Command. If they\n",
      "noticed anything remarkable about Pierre, it was only his unabashed,\n",
      "meditative concentration and thoughtfulness, and the way he spoke\n",
      "French, which struck them as surprisingly good. In spite of this he\n",
      "was placed that day with the other arrested suspects, as the\n",
      "separate room he had occupied was required by an officer.\n",
      "\n",
      "All the Russians confined with Pierre were men of the lowest class\n",
      "and, recognizing him as a gentleman, they all avoided him, more\n",
      "especially as he spoke French. Pierre felt sad at hearing them\n",
      "making fun of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "That evening he learned that all these prisoners (he, probably,\n",
      "among them) were to be tried for incendiarism. On the third day he was\n",
      "taken with the others to a house where a French general with a white\n",
      "mustache sat with two colonels and other Frenchmen with scarves on\n",
      "their arms. With the precision and definiteness customary in\n",
      "addressing prisoners, and which is supposed to preclude human frailty,\n",
      "Pierre like the others was questioned as to who he was, where he had\n",
      "been, with what object, and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "These questions, like questions put at trials generally, left the\n",
      "essence of the matter aside, shut out the possibility of that\n",
      "essence's being revealed, and were designed only to form a channel\n",
      "through which the judges wished the answers of the accused to flow\n",
      "so as to lead to the desired result, namely a conviction. As soon as\n",
      "Pierre began to say anything that did not fit in with that aim, the\n",
      "channel was removed and the water could flow to waste. Pierre felt,\n",
      "moreover, what the accused always feel at their trial, perplexity as\n",
      "to why these questions were put to him. He had a feeling that it was\n",
      "only out of condescension or a kind of civility that this device of\n",
      "placing a channel was employed. He knew he was in these men's power,\n",
      "that only by force had they brought him there, that force alone gave\n",
      "them the right to demand answers to their questions, and that the sole\n",
      "object of that assembly was to inculpate him. And so, as they had\n",
      "the power and wish to inculpate him, this expedient of an inquiry\n",
      "and trial seemed unnecessary. It was evident that any answer would\n",
      "lead to conviction. When asked what he was doing when he was arrested,\n",
      "Pierre replied in a rather tragic manner that he was restoring to\n",
      "its parents a child he had saved from the flames. Why had he fought\n",
      "the marauder? Pierre answered that he \"was protecting a woman,\" and\n",
      "that \"to protect a woman who was being insulted was the duty of\n",
      "every man; that...\" They interrupted him, for this was not to the\n",
      "point. Why was he in the yard of a burning house where witnesses had\n",
      "seen him? He replied that he had gone out to see what was happening in\n",
      "Moscow. Again they interrupted him: they had not asked where he was\n",
      "going, but why he was found near the fire? Who was he? they asked,\n",
      "repeating their first question, which he had declined to answer. Again\n",
      "he replied that he could not answer it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Put that down, that's bad... very bad,\" sternly remarked the\n",
      "general with the white mustache and red flushed face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "On the fourth day fires broke out on the Zubovski rampart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pierre and thirteen others were moved to the coach house of a\n",
      "merchant's house near the Crimean bridge. On his way through the\n",
      "streets Pierre felt stifled by the smoke which seemed to hang over the\n",
      "whole city. Fires were visible on all sides. He did not then realize\n",
      "the significance of the burning of Moscow, and looked at the fires\n",
      "with horror.\n",
      "\n",
      "He passed four days in the coach house near the Crimean bridge and\n",
      "during that time learned, from the talk of the French soldiers, that\n",
      "all those confined there were awaiting a decision which might come any\n",
      "day from the marshal. What marshal this was, Pierre could not learn\n",
      "from the soldiers. Evidently for them \"the marshal\" represented a very\n",
      "high and rather mysterious power.\n",
      "\n",
      "These first days, before the eighth of September when the\n",
      "prisoners were had up for a second examination, were the hardest of\n",
      "all for Pierre.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the eighth of September an officer--a very important one\n",
      "judging by the respect the guards showed him--entered the coach\n",
      "house where the prisoners were. This officer, probably someone on\n",
      "the staff, was holding a paper in his hand, and called over all the\n",
      "Russians there, naming Pierre as \"the man who does not give his name.\"\n",
      "Glancing indolently and indifferently at all the prisoners, he ordered\n",
      "the officer in charge to have them decently dressed and tidied up\n",
      "before taking them to the marshal. An hour later a squad of soldiers\n",
      "arrived and Pierre with thirteen others was led to the Virgin's Field.\n",
      "It was a fine day, sunny after rain, and the air was unusually pure.\n",
      "The smoke did not hang low as on the day when Pierre had been taken\n",
      "from the guardhouse on the Zubovski rampart, but rose through the pure\n",
      "air in columns. No flames were seen, but columns of smoke rose on\n",
      "all sides, and all Moscow as far as Pierre could see was one vast\n",
      "charred ruin. On all sides there were waste spaces with only stoves\n",
      "and chimney stacks still standing, and here and there the blackened\n",
      "walls of some brick houses. Pierre gazed at the ruins and did not\n",
      "recognize districts he had known well. Here and there he could see\n",
      "churches that had not been burned. The Kremlin, which was not\n",
      "destroyed, gleamed white in the distance with its towers and the\n",
      "belfry of Ivan the Great. The domes of the New Convent of the Virgin\n",
      "glittered brightly and its bells were ringing particularly clearly.\n",
      "These bells reminded Pierre that it was Sunday and the feast of the\n",
      "Nativity of the Virgin. But there seemed to be no one to celebrate\n",
      "this holiday: everywhere were blackened ruins, and the few Russians to\n",
      "be seen were tattered and frightened people who tried to hide when\n",
      "they saw the French.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was plain that the Russian nest was ruined and destroyed, but\n",
      "in place of the Russian order of life that had been destroyed,\n",
      "Pierre unconsciously felt that a quite different, firm, French order\n",
      "had been established over this ruined nest. He felt this in the\n",
      "looks of the soldiers who, marching in regular ranks briskly and\n",
      "gaily, were escorting him and the other criminals; he felt it in the\n",
      "looks of an important French official in a carriage and pair driven by\n",
      "a soldier, whom they met on the way. He felt it in the merry sounds of\n",
      "regimental music he heard from the left side of the field, and felt\n",
      "and realized it especially from the list of prisoners the French\n",
      "officer had read out when he came that morning. Pierre had been\n",
      "taken by one set of soldiers and led first to one and then to\n",
      "another place with dozens of other men, and it seemed that they\n",
      "might have forgotten him, or confused him with the others. But no: the\n",
      "answers he had given when questioned had come back to him in his\n",
      "designation as \"the man who does not give his name,\" and under that\n",
      "appellation, which to Pierre seemed terrible, they were now leading\n",
      "him somewhere with unhesitating assurance on their faces that he and\n",
      "all the other prisoners were exactly the ones they wanted and that\n",
      "they were being taken to the proper place. Pierre felt himself to be\n",
      "an insignificant chip fallen among the wheels of a machine whose\n",
      "action he did not understand but which was working well.\n",
      "\n",
      "He and the other prisoners were taken to the right side of the\n",
      "Virgin's Field, to a large white house with an immense garden not\n",
      "far from the convent. This was Prince Shcherbitov's house, where\n",
      "Pierre had often been in other days, and which, as he learned from the\n",
      "talk of the soldiers, was now occupied by the marshal, the Duke of\n",
      "Eckmuhl (Davout).\n",
      "\n",
      "They were taken to the entrance and led into the house one by one.\n",
      "Pierre was the sixth to enter. He was conducted through a glass\n",
      "gallery, an anteroom, and a hall, which were familiar to him, into a\n",
      "long low study at the door of which stood an adjutant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Davout, spectacles on nose, sat bent over a table at the further end\n",
      "of the room. Pierre went close up to him, but Davout, evidently\n",
      "consulting a paper that lay before him, did not look up. Without\n",
      "raising his eyes, he said in a low voice:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Pierre was silent because he was incapable of uttering a word. To\n",
      "him Davout was not merely a French general, but a man notorious for\n",
      "his cruelty. Looking at his cold face, as he sat like a stern\n",
      "schoolmaster who was prepared to wait awhile for an answer, Pierre\n",
      "felt that every instant of delay might cost him his life; but he did\n",
      "not know what to say. He did not venture to repeat what he had said at\n",
      "his first examination, yet to disclose his rank and position was\n",
      "dangerous and embarrassing. So he was silent. But before he had\n",
      "decided what to do, Davout raised his head, pushed his spectacles back\n",
      "on his forehead, screwed up his eyes, and looked intently at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know that man,\" he said in a cold, measured tone, evidently\n",
      "calculated to frighten Pierre.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chill that had been running down Pierre's back now seized his\n",
      "head as in a vise.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You cannot know me, General, I have never seen you...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He is a Russian spy,\" Davout interrupted, addressing another\n",
      "general who was present, but whom Pierre had not noticed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Davout turned away. With an unexpected reverberation in his voice\n",
      "Pierre rapidly began:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, monseigneur,\" he said, suddenly remembering that Davout was a\n",
      "duke. \"No, monseigneur, you cannot have known me. I am a militia\n",
      "officer and have not quitted Moscow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Monseigneur!\" exclaimed Pierre, not in an offended but in a\n",
      "pleading voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Davout looked up and gazed intently at him. For some seconds they\n",
      "looked at one another, and that look saved Pierre. Apart from\n",
      "conditions of war and law, that look established human relations\n",
      "between the two men. At that moment an immense number of things passed\n",
      "dimly through both their minds, and they realized that they were\n",
      "both children of humanity and were brothers.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the first glance, when Davout had only raised his head from the\n",
      "papers where human affairs and lives were indicated by numbers, Pierre\n",
      "was merely a circumstance, and Davout could have shot him without\n",
      "burdening his conscience with an evil deed, but now he saw in him a\n",
      "human being. He reflected for a moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How can you show me that you are telling the truth?\" said Davout\n",
      "coldly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pierre remembered Ramballe, and named him and his regiment and the\n",
      "street where the house was.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are not what you say,\" returned Davout.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a trembling, faltering voice Pierre began adducing proofs of\n",
      "the truth of his statements.\n",
      "\n",
      "But at that moment an adjutant entered and reported something to\n",
      "Davout.\n",
      "\n",
      "Davout brightened up at the news the adjutant brought, and began\n",
      "buttoning up his uniform. It seemed that he had quite forgotten\n",
      "Pierre.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the adjutant reminded him of the prisoner, he jerked his head\n",
      "in Pierre's direction with a frown and ordered him to be led away. But\n",
      "where they were to take him Pierre did not know: back to the coach\n",
      "house or to the place of execution his companions had pointed out to\n",
      "him as they crossed the Virgin's Field.\n",
      "\n",
      "He turned his head and saw that the adjutant was putting another\n",
      "question to Davout.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, of course!\" replied Davout, but what this \"yes\" meant,\n",
      "Pierre did not know.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pierre could not afterwards remember how he went, whether it was\n",
      "far, or in which direction. His faculties were quite numbed, he was\n",
      "stupefied, and noticing nothing around him went on moving his legs\n",
      "as the others did till they all stopped and he stopped too. The only\n",
      "thought in his mind at that time was: who was it that had really\n",
      "sentenced him to death? Not the men on the commission that had first\n",
      "examined him--not one of them wished to or, evidently, could have done\n",
      "it. It was not Davout, who had looked at him in so human a way. In\n",
      "another moment Davout would have realized that he was doing wrong, but\n",
      "just then the adjutant had come in and interrupted him. The\n",
      "adjutant, also, had evidently had no evil intent though he might\n",
      "have refrained from coming in. Then who was executing him, killing\n",
      "him, depriving him of life--him, Pierre, with all his memories,\n",
      "aspirations, hopes, and thoughts? Who was doing this? And Pierre\n",
      "felt that it was no one.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a system--a concurrence of circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "A system of some sort was killing him--Pierre--depriving him of\n",
      "life, of everything, annihilating him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "From Prince Shcherbatov's house the prisoners were led straight down\n",
      "the Virgin's Field, to the left of the nunnery, as far as a kitchen\n",

      "had been dug in the ground, and near the post and the pit a large\n",
      "crowd stood in a semicircle. The crowd consisted of a few Russians and\n",
      "many of Napoleon's soldiers who were not on duty--Germans, Italians,\n",
      "and Frenchmen, in a variety of uniforms. To the right and left of\n",
      "the post stood rows of French troops in blue uniforms with red\n",
      "epaulets and high boots and shakos.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prisoners were placed in a certain order, according to the\n",
      "list (Pierre was sixth), and were led to the post. Several drums\n",
      "suddenly began to beat on both sides of them, and at that sound Pierre\n",
      "felt as if part of his soul had been torn away. He lost the power of\n",
      "thinking or understanding. He could only hear and see. And he had only\n",
      "one wish--that the frightful thing that had to happen should happen\n",
      "quickly. Pierre looked round at his fellow prisoners and scrutinized\n",
      "them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two first were convicts with shaven heads. One was tall and\n",
      "thin, the other dark, shaggy, and sinewy, with a flat nose. The\n",
      "third was a domestic serf, about forty-five years old, with grizzled\n",
      "hair and a plump, well-nourished body. The fourth was a peasant, a\n",
      "very handsome man with a broad, light-brown beard and black eyes.\n",
      "The fifth was a factory hand, a thin, sallow-faced lad of eighteen\n",
      "in a loose coat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pierre heard the French consulting whether to shoot them\n",
      "separately or two at a time. \"In couples,\" replied the officer in\n",
      "command in a calm voice. There was a stir in the ranks of the soldiers\n",
      "and it was evident that they were all hurrying--not as men hurry to do\n",
      "something they understand, but as people hurry to finish a necessary\n",
      "but unpleasant and incomprehensible task.\n",
      "\n",
      "A French official wearing a scarf came up to the right of the row of\n",
      "prisoners and read out the sentence in Russian and in French.\n",

      "The convicts stopped when they reached the post and, while sacks\n",
      "were being brought, looked dumbly around as a wounded beast looks at\n",
      "an approaching huntsman. One crossed himself continually, the other\n",
      "scratched his back and made a movement of the lips resembling a smile.\n",
      "With hurried hands the soldiers blindfolded them, drawing the sacks\n",
      "over their heads, and bound them to the post.\n",
      "\n",
      "Twelve sharpshooters with muskets stepped out of the ranks with a\n",
      "firm regular tread and halted eight paces from the post. Pierre turned\n",
      "away to avoid seeing what was going to happen. Suddenly a crackling,\n",
      "rolling noise was heard which seemed to him louder than the most\n",
      "terrific thunder, and he looked round. There was some smoke, and the\n",
      "Frenchmen were doing something near the pit, with pale faces and\n",
      "trembling hands. Two more prisoners were led up. In the same way and\n",
      "with similar looks, these two glanced vainly at the onlookers with\n",
      "only a silent appeal for protection in their eyes, evidently unable to\n",
      "understand or believe what was going to happen to them. They could not\n",
      "believe it because they alone knew what their life meant to them,\n",
      "and so they neither understood nor believed that it could be taken\n",
      "from them.\n",

      "Frenchmen who were again doing something by the post, their\n",
      "trembling hands impeding one another. Pierre, breathing heavily,\n",
      "looked around as if asking what it meant. The same question was\n",
      "expressed in all the looks that met his.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the faces of all the Russians and of the French soldiers and\n",
      "officers without exception, he read the same dismay, horror, and\n",
      "conflict that were in his own heart. \"But who, after all, is doing\n",
      "this? They are all suffering as I am. Who then is it? Who?\" flashed\n",
      "for an instant through his mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sharpshooters of the 86th, forward!\" shouted someone. The fifth\n",
      "prisoner, the one next to Pierre, was led away--alone. Pierre did\n",
      "not understand that he was saved, that he and the rest had been\n",
      "brought there only to witness the execution. With ever-growing horror,\n",
      "and no sense of joy or relief, he gazed at what was taking place.\n",
      "The fifth man was the factory lad in the loose cloak. The moment\n",
      "they laid hands on him he sprang aside in terror and clutched at\n",
      "Pierre. (Pierre shuddered and shook himself free.) The lad was\n",
      "unable to walk. They dragged him along, holding him up under the arms,\n",
      "and he screamed. When they got him to the post he grew quiet, as if he\n",
      "suddenly understood something. Whether he understood that screaming\n",
      "was useless or whether he thought it incredible that men should kill\n",
      "him, at any rate he took his stand at the post, waiting to be\n",
      "blindfolded like the others, and like a wounded animal looked around\n",
      "him with glittering eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pierre was no longer able to turn away and close his eyes. His\n",
      "curiosity and agitation, like that of the whole crowd, reached the\n",
      "highest pitch at this fifth murder. Like the others this fifth man\n",
      "seemed calm; he wrapped his loose cloak closer and rubbed one bare\n",
      "foot with the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they began to blindfold him he himself adjusted the knot\n",
      "which hurt the back of his head; then when they propped him against\n",
      "the bloodstained post, he leaned back and, not being comfortable in\n",
      "that position, straightened himself, adjusted his feet, and leaned\n",
      "back again more comfortably. Pierre did not take his eyes from him and\n",
      "did not miss his slightest movement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Probably a word of command was given and was followed by the reports\n",
      "of eight muskets; but try as he would Pierre could not afterwards\n",
      "remember having heard the slightest sound of the shots. He only saw\n",
      "how the workman suddenly sank down on the cords that held him, how\n",
      "blood showed itself in two places, how the ropes slackened under the\n",
      "weight of the hanging body, and how the workman sat down, his head\n",
      "hanging unnaturally and one leg bent under him. Pierre ran up to the\n",
      "post. No one hindered him. Pale, frightened people were doing\n",
      "something around the workman. The lower jaw of an old Frenchman with a\n",
      "thick mustache trembled as he untied the ropes. The body collapsed.\n",
      "The soldiers dragged it awkwardly from the post and began pushing it\n",
      "into the pit.\n",
      "\n",
      "They all plainly and certainly knew that they were criminals who\n",
      "must hide the traces of their guilt as quickly as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pierre glanced into the pit and saw that the factory lad was lying\n",
      "with his knees close up to his head and one shoulder higher than the\n",
      "other. That shoulder rose and fell rhythmically and convulsively,\n",
      "but spadefuls of earth were already being thrown over the whole\n",
      "body. One of the soldiers, evidently suffering, shouted gruffly and\n",
      "angrily at Pierre to go back. But Pierre did not understand him and\n",
      "remained near the post, and no one drove him away.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the pit had been filled up a command was given. Pierre was\n",
      "taken back to his place, and the rows of troops on both sides of the\n",
      "post made a half turn and went past it at a measured pace. The\n",
      "twenty-four sharpshooters with discharged muskets, standing in the\n",
      "center of the circle, ran back to their places as the companies passed\n",
      "by.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pierre gazed now with dazed eyes at these sharpshooters who ran in\n",
      "couples out of the circle. All but one rejoined their companies.\n",
      "This one, a young soldier, his face deadly pale, his shako pushed\n",
      "back, and his musket resting on the ground, still stood near the pit\n",
      "at the spot from which he had fired. He swayed like a drunken man,\n",
      "taking some steps forward and back to save himself from falling. An\n",
      "old, noncommissioned officer ran out of the ranks and taking him by\n",
      "the elbow dragged him to his company. The crowd of Russians and\n",
      "Frenchmen began to disperse. They all went away silently and with\n",
      "drooping heads.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That will teach them to start fires,\" said one of the Frenchmen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pierre glanced round at the speaker and saw that it was a soldier\n",
      "who was trying to find some relief after what had been done, but was\n",
      "not able to do so. Without finishing what he had begun to say he\n",
      "made a hopeless movement with his arm and went away.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "After the execution Pierre was separated from the rest of the\n",
      "prisoners and placed alone in a small, ruined, and befouled church.\n",
      "\n",
      "Toward evening a noncommissioned officer entered with two soldiers\n",
      "and told him that he had been pardoned and would now go to the\n",
      "barracks for the prisoners of war. Without understanding what was said\n",
      "to him, Pierre got up and went with the soldiers. They took him to the\n",
      "upper end of the field, where there were some sheds built of charred\n",
      "planks, beams, and battens, and led him into one of them. In the\n",
      "darkness some twenty different men surrounded Pierre. He looked at\n",
      "them without understanding who they were, why they were there, or what\n",
      "they wanted of him. He heard what they said, but did not understand\n",
      "the meaning of the words and made no kind of deduction from or\n",
      "application of them. He replied to questions they put to him, but\n",
      "did not consider who was listening to his replies, nor how they\n",
      "would understand them. He looked at their faces and figures, but\n",
      "they all seemed to him equally meaningless.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the moment Pierre had witnessed those terrible murders\n",
      "committed by men who did not wish to commit them, it was as if the\n",
      "mainspring of his life, on which everything depended and which made\n",
      "everything appear alive, had suddenly been wrenched out and everything\n",
      "had collapsed into a heap of meaningless rubbish. Though he did not\n",
      "acknowledge it to himself, his faith in the right ordering of the\n",
      "universe, in humanity, in his own soul, and in God, had been\n",
      "destroyed. He had experienced this before, but never so strongly as\n",
      "now. When similar doubts had assailed him before, they had been the\n",
      "result of his own wrongdoing, and at the bottom of his heart he had\n",
      "felt that relief from his despair and from those doubts was to be\n",
      "found within himself. But now he felt that the universe had crumbled\n",
      "before his eyes and only meaningless ruins remained, and this not by\n",
      "any fault of his own. He felt that it was not in his power to regain\n",
      "faith in the meaning of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Around him in the darkness men were standing and evidently something\n",
      "about him interested them greatly. They were telling him something and\n",
      "asking him something. Then they led him away somewhere, and at last he\n",
      "found himself in a corner of the shed among men who were laughing\n",
      "and talking on all sides.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, then, mates... that very prince who...\" some voice at the\n",
      "other end of the shed was saying, with a strong emphasis on the word\n",
      "who.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sitting silent and motionless on a heap of straw against the wall,\n",
      "Pierre sometimes opened and sometimes closed his eyes. But as soon\n",
      "as he closed them he saw before him the dreadful face of the factory\n",
      "lad--especially dreadful because of its simplicity--and the faces of\n",
      "the murderers, even more dreadful because of their disquiet. And he\n",
      "opened his eyes again and stared vacantly into the darkness around\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beside him in a stooping position sat a small man of whose\n",
      "presence he was first made aware by a strong smell of perspiration\n",
      "which came from him every time he moved. This man was doing\n",
      "something to his legs in the darkness, and though Pierre could not see\n",
      "his face he felt that the man continually glanced at him. On growing\n",
      "used to the darkness Pierre saw that the man was taking off his leg\n",
      "bands, and the way he did it aroused Pierre's interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having unwound the string that tied the band on one leg, he\n",
      "carefully coiled it up and immediately set to work on the other leg,\n",
      "glancing up at Pierre. While one hand hung up the first string the\n",
      "other was already unwinding the band on the second leg. In this way,\n",
      "having carefully removed the leg bands by deft circular motions of his\n",
      "arm following one another uninterruptedly, the man hung the leg\n",
      "bands up on some pegs fixed above his head. Then he took out a\n",
      "knife, cut something, closed the knife, placed it under the head of\n",
      "his bed, and, seating himself comfortably, clasped his arms round\n",
      "his lifted knees and fixed his eyes on Pierre. The latter was\n",
      "conscious of something pleasant, comforting, and well rounded in these\n",
      "deft movements, in the man's well-ordered arrangements in his\n",
      "corner, and even in his very smell, and he looked at the man without\n",
      "taking his eyes from him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You've seen a lot of trouble, sir, eh?\" the little man suddenly\n",
      "said.\n",
      "\n",
      "And there was so much kindliness and simplicity in his singsong\n",
      "voice that Pierre tried to reply, but his jaw trembled and he felt\n",
      "tears rising to his eyes. The little fellow, giving Pierre no time\n",
      "to betray his confusion, instantly continued in the same pleasant\n",
      "tones:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Eh, lad, don't fret!\" said he, in the tender singsong caressing\n",
      "voice old Russian peasant women employ. \"Don't fret, friend--'suffer\n",
      "an hour, live for an age!' that's how it is, my dear fellow. And\n",
      "here we live, thank heaven, without offense. Among these folk, too,\n",
      "there are good men as well as bad,\" said he, and still speaking, he\n",
      "turned on his knees with a supple movement, got up, coughed, and\n",
      "went off to another part of the shed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Eh, you rascal!\" Pierre heard the same kind voice saying at the\n",
      "other end of the shed. \"So you've come, you rascal? She remembers...\n",
      "Now, now, that'll do!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How can one help it, lad? My name is Platon, and the surname is\n",
      "Karataev,\" he added, evidently wishing to make it easier for Pierre to\n",
      "address him. \"They call me 'little falcon' in the regiment. How is one\n",
      "to help feeling sad? Moscow--she's the mother of cities. How can one\n",
      "see all this and not feel sad? But 'the maggot gnaws the cabbage,\n",
      "yet dies first'; that's what the old folks used to tell us,\" he\n",
      "added rapidly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who? I?\" said Karataev. \"I say things happen not as we plan but\n",
      "as God judges,\" he replied, thinking that he was repeating what he had\n",
      "said before, and immediately continued:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, and you, have you a family estate, sir? And a house? So you\n",
      "have abundance, then? And a housewife? And your old parents, are\n",
      "they still living?\" he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "And though it was too dark for Pierre to see, he felt that a\n",
      "suppressed smile of kindliness puckered the soldier's lips as he put\n",
      "these questions. He seemed grieved that Pierre had no parents,\n",
      "especially that he had no mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A wife for counsel, a mother-in-law for welcome, but there's none\n",
      "as dear as one's own mother!\" said he. \"Well, and have you little\n",
      "ones?\" he went on asking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again Pierre's negative answer seemed to distress him, and he\n",
      "hastened to add:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never mind! You're young folks yet, and please God may still have\n",
      "some. The great thing is to live in harmony....\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But it's all the same now,\" Pierre could not help saying.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, my dear fellow!\" rejoined Karataev, \"never decline a prison\n",
      "or a beggar's sack!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He seated himself more comfortably and coughed, evidently\n",
      "preparing to tell a long story.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, my dear fellow, I was still living at home,\" he began. \"We\n",
      "had a well-to-do homestead, plenty of land, we peasants lived well and\n",
      "our house was one to thank God for. When Father and we went out mowing\n",
      "there were seven of us. We lived well. We were real peasants. It so\n",
      "happened...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And Platon Karataev told a long story of how he had gone into\n",
      "someone's copse to take wood, how he had been caught by the keeper,\n",
      "had been tried, flogged, and sent to serve as a soldier.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, lad,\" and a smile changed the tone of his voice \"we thought\n",
      "it was a misfortune but it turned out a blessing! If it had not been\n",
      "for my sin, my brother would have had to go as a soldier. But he, my\n",
      "younger brother, had five little ones, while I, you see, only left a\n",
      "wife behind. We had a little girl, but God took her before I went as a\n",
      "soldier. I come home on leave and I'll tell you how it was, I look and\n",
      "see that they are living better than before. The yard full of\n",
      "cattle, the women at home, two brothers away earning wages, and only\n",
      "Michael the youngest, at home. Father, he says, 'All my children are\n",
      "the same to me: it hurts the same whichever finger gets bitten. But if\n",
      "Platon hadn't been shaved for a soldier, Michael would have had to\n",
      "go.' called us all to him and, will you believe it, placed us in front\n",
      "of the icons. 'Michael,' he says, 'come here and bow down to his feet;\n",
      "and you, young woman, you bow down too; and you, grandchildren, also\n",
      "bow down before him! Do you understand?' he says. That's how it is,\n",
      "dear fellow. Fate looks for a head. But we are always judging, 'that's\n",
      "not well--that's not right!' Our luck is like water in a dragnet:\n",
      "you pull at it and it bulges, but when you've drawn it out it's empty!\n",
      "That's how it is.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Twenty-three soldiers, three officers, and two officials were\n",
      "confined in the shed in which Pierre had been placed and where he\n",
      "remained for four weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Pierre remembered them afterwards they all seemed misty figures\n",
      "to him except Platon Karataev, who always remained in his mind a\n",
      "most vivid and precious memory and the personification of everything\n",
      "Russian, kindly, and round. When Pierre saw his neighbor next\n",
      "morning at dawn the first impression of him, as of something round,\n",
      "was fully confirmed: Platon's whole figure--in a French overcoat\n",
      "girdled with a cord, a soldier's cap, and bast shoes--was round. His\n",
      "head was quite round, his back, chest, shoulders, and even his arms,\n",
      "which he held as if ever ready to embrace something, were rounded, his\n",
      "pleasant smile and his large, gentle brown eyes were also round.\n",
      "\n",
      "Platon Karataev must have been fifty, judging by his stories of\n",
      "campaigns he had been in, told as by an old soldier. He did not\n",
      "himself know his age and was quite unable to determine it. But his\n",
      "brilliantly white, strong teeth which showed in two unbroken\n",
      "semicircles when he laughed--as he often did--were all sound and good,\n",
      "there was not a gray hair in his beard or on his head, and his whole\n",
      "body gave an impression of suppleness and especially of firmness and\n",
      "endurance.\n",
      "\n",
      "His face, despite its fine, rounded wrinkles, had an expression of\n",
      "innocence and youth, his voice was pleasant and musical. But the chief\n",
      "peculiarity of his speech was its directness and appositeness. It\n",
      "was evident that he never considered what he had said or was going\n",
      "to say, and consequently the rapidity and justice of his intonation\n",
      "had an irresistible persuasiveness.\n",
      "\n",
      "His physical strength and agility during the first days of his\n",
      "imprisonment were such that he seemed not to know what fatigue and\n",
      "sickness meant. Every night before lying down, he said: \"Lord, lay\n",
      "me down as a stone and raise me up as a loaf!\" and every morning on\n",
      "getting up, he said: \"I lay down and curled up, I get up and shake\n",
      "myself.\" And indeed he only had to lie down, to fall asleep like a\n",
      "stone, and he only had to shake himself, to be ready without a\n",
      "moment's delay for some work, just as children are ready to play\n",
      "directly they awake. He could do everything, not very well but not\n",
      "badly. He baked, cooked, sewed, planed, and mended boots. He was\n",
      "always busy, and only at night allowed himself conversation--of\n",
      "which he was fond--and songs. He did not sing like a trained singer\n",
      "who knows he is listened to, but like the birds, evidently giving vent\n",
      "to the sounds in the same way that one stretches oneself or walks\n",

      "Sample Sentences: ['as things now stand the course of instruction in american history in our public schools embraces three distinct treatments of the subject three separate books are used first there is the primary book which is usually a very condensed narrative with emphasis on biographies and anecdotes second there is the advanced text for the seventh or eighth grade generally speaking an expansion of the elementary book by the addition of forty or fifty thousand words finally there is the high school manual this too ordinarily follows the beaten path giving fuller accounts of the same events and characters to put it bluntly we do not assume that our children obtain permanent possessions from their study of history in the lower grades if mathematicians followed the same method high school texts on algebra and geometry would include the multiplication table and fractions there is of course a ready answer to the criticism advanced above it is that teachers have learned from bitter experience how little history their pupils retain as they pass along the regular route no teacher of history will deny this still it is a standing challenge to existing methods of historical instruction if the study of history cannot be made truly progressive like the study of mathematics science and languages then the historians assume a grave responsibility in adding their subject to the already overloaded curriculum if the successive historical texts are only enlarged editions of the first textmore facts more dates more wordsthen history deserves most of the sharp criticism which it is receiving from teachers of science civics and economics in this condition of affairs we find our justification for offering a new high school text in american history our first contribution is one of omission the timehonored stories of exploration and the biographies of heroes are left out we frankly hold that if pupils know little or nothing about columbus cortes magellan or captain john smith by the time they reach the high school it is useless to tell the same stories for perhaps the fourth time it is worse than useless it is an offense against the teachers of those subjects that are demonstrated to be progressive in character in the next place we have omitted all descriptions of battles our reasons for this are simple the strategy of a campaign or of a single battle is a highly technical and usually a highly controversial matter about which experts differ widely in the field of military and naval operations most writers and teachers of history are mere novices to dispose of gettysburg or the wilderness in ten lines or ten pages is equally absurd to the serious student of military affairs any one who compares the ordinary textbook account of a single civil war campaign with the account given by ropes for instance will ask for no further comment no youth called upon to serve our country in arms would think of turning to a high school manual for information about the art of warfare the dramatic scene or episode so useful in arousing the interest of the immature pupil seems out of place in a book that deliberately appeals to boys and girls on the very threshold of lifes serious responsibilities consolation for our defeat by the memory of former victories and the words of rostopchin that french soldiers have to be incited to battle by highfalutin words and germans by logical arguments to show them that it is more dangerous to run away than to advance but that russian soldiers only need to be restrained and held back on all sides new and fresh anecdotes were heard of individual examples of heroism shown by our officers and men at austerlitz one had saved a standard another had killed five frenchmen a third had loaded five cannon singlehanded berg was mentioned by those who did not know him as having when wounded in the right hand taken his sword in the left and gone forward of bolkonski nothing was said and only those who knew him intimately regretted that he had died so young leaving a pregnant wife with his eccentric father on that third of march all the rooms in the english club were filled with a hum of conversation like the hum of bees swarming in springtime the members and guests of the club wandered hither and thither sat stood met and separated some in uniform and some in evening dress and a few here and there with powdered hair and in russian kaftans powdered footmen in livery with buckled shoes and smart stockings stood at every door anxiously noting visitors every movement in order to offer their services most of those present were elderly respected men with broad selfconfident faces fat fingers and resolute gestures and voices this class of guests and members sat in certain habitual places and met in certain habitual groups a minority of those present were casual guestschiefly young men among whom were denisov rostov and dolokhovwho was now again an officer in the semenov regiment the faces of these young people especially those who were militarymen bore that expression of condescending respect for their elders which seems to say to the older generation we are prepared to respect and honor you but all the same remember that the future belongs to us nesvitski was there as an old member of the club pierre who at his wifes command had let his hair grow and abandoned his spectacles went about the rooms fashionably dressed but looking sad and dull here as elsewhere he was surrounded by an atmosphere of subservience to his wealth and being in the habit of lording it over these people he treated them with absentminded contempt the torzhok peddler woman in a whining voice went on offering her wares especially a pair of goatskin slippers i have hundreds of rubles i dont know what to do with and she stands in her tattered cloak looking timidly at me he thought and what does she want the money for as if that money could add a hairs breadth to happiness or peace of mind can anything in the world make her or me less a prey to evil and deathdeath which ends all and must come today or tomorrowat any rate in an instant as compared with eternity and again he twisted the screw with the stripped thread and again it turned uselessly in the same place his servant handed him a halfcut novel in the form of letters by madame de souza he began reading about the sufferings and virtuous struggles of a certain emilie de mansfeld and why did she resist her seducer when she loved him he thought god could not have put into her heart an impulse that was against his will my wifeas she once wasdid not struggle and perhaps she was right nothing has been found out nothing discovered pierre again said to himself all we can know is that we know nothing and thats the height of human wisdom everything within and around him seemed confused senseless and repellent yet in this very repugnance to all his circumstances pierre found a kind of tantalizing satisfaction i make bold to ask your excellency to move a little for this gentleman said the postmaster entering the room followed by another traveler also detained for lack of horses the newcomer was a short largeboned yellowfaced wrinkled old man with gray bushy eyebrows overhanging bright eyes of an indefinite grayish color pierre took his feet off the table stood up and lay down on a bed that had been got ready for him glancing now and then at the newcomer who with a gloomy and tired face was wearily taking off his wraps with the aid of his servant and not looking at pierre with a pair of felt boots on his thin bony legs and keeping on a worn nankeencovered sheepskin coat the traveler sat down on the sofa leaned back his big head with its broad temples and closecropped hair and looked at bezukhov the stern shrewd and penetrating expression of that look struck pierre he felt a wish to speak to the stranger but by the time he had made up his mind to ask him a question about the roads the traveler had closed his eyes his shriveled old hands were folded and on the finger of one of them pierre noticed a large cast iron ring with a seal representing a deaths head the stranger sat without stirring either resting or as it seemed to pierre sunk in profound and calm meditation his servant was also a yellow wrinkled old man without beard or mustache evidently not because he was shaven but because they had never grown this active old servant was unpacking the travelers canteen and preparing tea he brought in a boiling samovar when everything was ready the stranger opened his eyes moved to the table filled a tumbler with tea for himself and one for the beardless old man to whom he passed it pierre began to feel a sense of uneasiness and the need even the inevitability of entering into conversation with this stranger what pierre did not know was that the place where they presented him with bread and salt and wished to build a chantry in honor of peter and paul was a market village where a fair was held on st peters day and that the richest peasants who formed the deputation had begun the chantry long before but that nine tenths of the peasants in that villages were in a state of the greatest poverty he did not know that since the nursing mothers were no longer sent to work on his land they did still harder work on their own land he did not know that the priest who met him with the cross oppressed the peasants by his exactions and that the pupils parents wept at having to let him take their children and secured their release by heavy payments he did not know that the brick buildings built to plan were being built by serfs whose manorial labor was thus increased though lessened on paper he did not know that where the steward had shown him in the accounts that the serfs payments had been diminished by a third their obligatory manorial work had been increased by a half and so pierre was delighted with his visit to his estates and quite recovered the philanthropic mood in which he had left petersburg and wrote enthusiastic letters to his brotherinstructor as he called the grand master how easy it is how little effort it needs to do so much good thought pierre and how little attention we pay to it he was pleased at the gratitude he received but felt abashed at receiving it this gratitude reminded him of how much more he might do for these simple kindly people the chief steward a very stupid but cunning man who saw perfectly through the naive and intelligent count and played with him as with a toy seeing the effect these prearranged receptions had on pierre pressed him still harder with proofs of the impossibility and above all the uselessness of freeing the serfs who were quite happy as it was pierre in his secret soul agreed with the steward that it would be difficult to imagine happier people and that god only knew what would happen to them when they were free but he insisted though reluctantly on what he thought right the steward promised to do all in his power to carry out the counts wishes seeing clearly that not only would the count never be able to find out whether all measures had been taken for the sale of the land and forests and to release them from the land bank but would probably never even inquire and would never know that the newly erected buildings were standing empty and that the serfs continued to give in money and work all that other peoples serfs gavethat is to say all that could be got out of them on the twentyninth of may napoleon left dresden where he had spent three weeks surrounded by a court that included princes dukes kings and even an emperor before leaving napoleon showed favor to the emperor kings and princes who had deserved it reprimanded the kings and princes with whom he was dissatisfied presented pearls and diamonds of his ownthat is which he had taken from other kings to the empress of austria and having as his historian tells us tenderly embraced the empress marie louisewho regarded him as her husband though he had left another wife in parisleft her grieved by the parting which she seemed hardly able to bear though the diplomatists still firmly believed in the possibility of peace and worked zealously to that end and though the emperor napoleon himself wrote a letter to alexander calling him monsieur mon frere and sincerely assured him that he did not want war and would always love and honor himyet he set off to join his army and at every station gave fresh orders to accelerate the movement of his troops from west to east he went in a traveling coach with six horses surrounded by pages aidesdecamp and an escort along the road to posen thorn danzig and konigsberg at each of these towns thousands of people met him with excitement and enthusiasm the army was moving from west to east and relays of six horses carried him in the same direction on the tenth of june coming up with the army he spent the night in apartments prepared for him on the estate of a polish count in the vilkavisski forest next day overtaking the army he went in a carriage to the niemen and changing into a polish uniform he drove to the riverbank in order to select a place for the crossing seeing on the other side some cossacks les cosaques and the widespreading steppes in the midst of which lay the holy city of moscow moscou la ville sainte the capital of a realm such as the scythia into which alexander the great had marchednapoleon unexpectedly and contrary alike to strategic and diplomatic considerations ordered an advance and the next day his army began to cross the niemen early in the morning of the twelfth of june he came out of his tent which was pitched that day on the steep left bank of the niemen and looked through a spyglass at the streams of his troops pouring out of the vilkavisski forest and flowing over the three bridges thrown across the river the troops knowing of the emperors presence were on the lookout for him and when they caught sight of a figure in an overcoat and a cocked hat standing apart from his suite in front of his tent on the hill they threw up their caps and shouted vive lempereur and one after another poured in a ceaseless stream out of the vast forest that had concealed them and separating flowed on and on by the three bridges to the other side now well go into action oh when he takes it in hand himself things get hot by heaven there he is vive lempereur so these are the steppes of asia its a nasty country all the same au revoir beauche ill keep the best palace in moscow for you au revoir good luck did you see the emperor vive lempereur preurif they make me governor of india gerard ill make you minister of kashmirthats settled vive lempereur hurrah hurrah hurrah the cossacksthose rascalssee how they run vive lempereur there he is do you see him ive seen him twice as i see you now the little corporal i saw him give the cross to one of the veterans vive lempereur came the voices of men old and young of most diverse characters and social positions on the faces of all was one common expression of joy at the commencement of the longexpected campaign and of rapture and devotion to the man in the gray coat who was standing on the hill on the thirteenth of june a rather small thoroughbred arab horse was brought to napoleon he mounted it and rode at a gallop to one of the bridges over the niemen deafened continually by incessant and rapturous acclamations which he evidently endured only because it was impossible to forbid the soldiers to express their love of him by such shouting but the shouting which accompanied him everywhere disturbed him and distracted him from the military cares that had occupied him from the time he joined the army he rode across one of the swaying pontoon bridges to the farther side turned sharply to the left and galloped in the direction of kovno preceded by enraptured mounted chasseurs of the guard who breathless with delight galloped ahead to clear a path for him through the troops on reaching the broad river viliya he stopped near a regiment of polish uhlans stationed by the river vivat shouted the poles ecstatically breaking their ranks and pressing against one another to see him napoleon looked up and down the river dismounted and sat down on a log that lay on the bank at a mute sign from him a telescope was handed him which he rested on the back of a happy page who had run up to him and he gazed at the opposite bank then he became absorbed in a map laid out on the logs without lifting his head he said something and two of his aidesdecamp galloped off to the polish uhlans what what did he say was heard in the ranks of the polish uhlans when one of the aidesdecamp rode up to them the order was to find a ford and to cross the river the colonel of the polish uhlans a handsome old man flushed and fumbling in his speech from excitement asked the aidedecamp whether he would be permitted to swim the river with his uhlans instead of seeking a ford in evident fear of refusal like a boy asking for permission to get on a horse he begged to be allowed to swim across the river before the emperors eyes the aidedecamp replied that probably the emperor would not be displeased at this excess of zeal as soon as the aidedecamp had said this the old mustached officer with happy face and sparkling eyes raised his saber shouted vivat and commanding the uhlans to follow him spurred his horse and galloped into the river he gave an angry thrust to his horse which had grown restive under him and plunged into the water heading for the deepest part where the current was swift hundreds of uhlans galloped in after him it was cold and uncanny in the rapid current in the middle of the stream and the uhlans caught hold of one another as they fell off their horses some of the horses were drowned and some of the men the others tried to swim on some in the saddle and some clinging to their horses manes they tried to make their way forward to the opposite bank and though there was a ford one third of a mile away were proud that they were swimming and drowning in this river under the eyes of the man who sat on the log and was not even looking at what they were doing when the aidedecamp having returned and choosing an opportune moment ventured to draw the emperors attention to the devotion of the poles to his person the little man in the gray overcoat got up and having summoned berthier began pacing up and down the bank with him giving him instructions and occasionally glancing disapprovingly at the drowning uhlans who distracted his attention for him it was no new conviction that his presence in any part of the world from africa to the steppes of muscovy alike was enough to dumfound people and impel them to insane selfoblivion he called for his horse and rode to his quarters some forty uhlans were drowned in the river though boats were sent to their assistance the majority struggled back to the bank from which they had started the colonel and some of his men got across and with difficulty clambered out on the further bank and as soon as they had got out in their soaked and streaming clothes they shouted vivat and looked ecstatically at the spot where napoleon had been but where he no longer was and at that moment considered themselves happy that evening between issuing one order that the forged russian paper money prepared for use in russia should be delivered as quickly as possible and another that a saxon should be shot on whom a letter containing information about the orders to the french army had been found napoleon also gave instructions that the polish colonel who had needlessly plunged into the river should be enrolled in the legion dhonneur of which napoleon was himself the head quos vult perdere dementat those whom god wishes to destroy he drives mad chapter iii the emperor of russia had meanwhile been in vilna for more than a month reviewing troops and holding maneuvers nothing was ready for the war that everyone expected and to prepare for which the emperor had come from petersburg there was no general plan of action the vacillation between the various plans that were proposed had even increased after the emperor had been at headquarters for a month each of the three armies had its own commander in chief but there was no supreme commander of all the forces and the emperor did not assume that responsibility himself the longer the emperor remained in vilna the less did everybody tired of waitingprepare for the war all the efforts of those who surrounded the sovereign seemed directed merely to making him spend his time pleasantly and forget that war was impending in june after many balls and fetes given by the polish magnates by the courtiers and by the emperor himself it occurred to one of the polish aidesdecamp in attendance that a dinner and ball should be given for the emperor by his aidesdecamp this idea was eagerly received the emperor gave his consent the aidesdecamp collected money by subscription the lady who was thought to be most pleasing to the emperor was invited to act as hostess count bennigsen being a landowner in the vilna province offered his country house for the fete and the thirteenth of june was fixed for a ball dinner regatta and fireworks at zakret count bennigsens country seat the very day that napoleon issued the order to cross the niemen and his vanguard driving off the cossacks crossed the russian frontier alexander spent the evening at the entertainment given by his aidesdecamp at bennigsens country house it was a gay and brilliant fete connoisseurs of such matters declared that rarely had so many beautiful women been assembled in one place countess bezukhova was present among other russian ladies who had followed the sovereign from petersburg to vilna and eclipsed the refined polish ladies by her massive so called russian type of beauty the emperor noticed her and honored her with a dance boris drubetskoy having left his wife in moscow and being for the present en garcon as he phrased it was also there and though not an aidedecamp had subscribed a large sum toward the expenses boris was now a rich man who had risen to high honors and no longer sought patronage but stood on an equal footing with the highest of those of his own age he was meeting helene in vilna after not having seen her for a long time and did not recall the past but as helene was enjoying the favors of a very important personage and boris had only recently married they met as good friends of long standing at midnight dancing was still going on helene not having a suitable partner herself offered to dance the mazurka with boris they were the third couple boris coolly looking at helenes dazzling bare shoulders which emerged from a dark goldembroidered gauze gown talked to her of old acquaintances and at the same time unaware of it himself and unnoticed by others never for an instant ceased to observe the emperor who was in the same room the emperor was not dancing he stood in the doorway stopping now one pair and now another with gracious words which he alone knew how to utter as the mazurka began boris saw that adjutant general balashev one of those in closest attendance on the emperor went up to him and contrary to court etiquette stood near him while he was talking to a polish lady having finished speaking to her the emperor looked inquiringly at balashev and evidently understanding that he only acted thus because there were important reasons for so doing nodded slightly to the lady and turned to him hardly had balashev begun to speak before a look of amazement appeared on the emperors face he took balashev by the arm and crossed the room with him unconsciously clearing a path seven yards wide as the people on both sides made way for him boris noticed arakcheevs excited face when the sovereign went out with balashev arakcheev looked at the emperor from under his brow and sniffing with his red nose stepped forward from the crowd as if expecting the emperor to address him boris understood that arakcheev envied balashev and was displeased that evidently important news had reached the emperor otherwise than through himself but the emperor and balashev passed out into the illuminated garden without noticing arakcheev who holding his sword and glancing wrathfully around followed some twenty paces behind them all the time boris was going through the figures of the mazurka he was worried by the question of what news balashev had brought and how he could find it out before others in the figure in which he had to choose two ladies he whispered to helene that he meant to choose countess potocka who he thought had gone out onto the veranda and glided over the parquet to the door opening into the garden where seeing balashev and the emperor returning to the veranda he stood still they were moving toward the door boris fluttering as if he had not had time to withdraw respectfully pressed close to the doorpost with bowed head the emperor with the agitation of one who has been personally affronted was finishing with these words to enter russia without declaring war i will not make peace as long as a single armed enemy remains in my country it seemed to boris that it gave the emperor pleasure to utter these words he was satisfied with the form in which he had expressed his thoughts but displeased that boris had overheard it let no one know of it the emperor added with a frown boris understood that this was meant for him and closing his eyes slightly bowed his head the emperor reentered the ballroom and remained there about another halfhour boris was thus the first to learn the news that the french army had crossed the niemen and thanks to this was able to show certain important personages that much that was concealed from others was usually known to him and by this means he rose higher in their estimation the unexpected news of the french having crossed the niemen was particularly startling after a month of unfulfilled expectations and at a ball on first receiving the news under the influence of indignation and resentment the emperor had found a phrase that pleased him fully expressed his feelings and has since become famous on returning home at two oclock that night he sent for his secretary shishkov and told him to write an order to the troops and a rescript to field marshal prince saltykov in which he insisted on the words being inserted that he would not make peace so long as a single armed frenchman remained on russian soil next day the following letter was sent to napoleon monsieur mon frere yesterday i learned that despite the loyalty which i have kept my engagements with your majesty your troops have crossed the russian frontier and i have this moment received from petersburg a note in which count lauriston informs me as a reason for this aggression that your majesty has considered yourself to be in a state of war with me from the time prince kuragin asked for his passports the reasons on which the duc de bassano based his refusal to deliver them to him would never have led me to suppose that that could serve as a pretext for aggression in fact the ambassador as he himself has declared was never authorized to make that demand and as soon as i was informed of it i let him know how much i disapproved of it and ordered him to remain at his post if your majesty does not intend to shed the blood of our peoples for such a misunderstanding and consents to withdraw your troops from russian territory i will regard what has passed as not having occurred and an understanding between us will be possible in the contrary case your majesty i shall see myself forced to repel an attack that nothing on my part has provoked it still depends on your majesty to preserve humanity from the calamity of another war i am etc signed alexander chapter iv at two in the morning of the fourteenth of june the emperor having sent for balashev and read him his letter to napoleon ordered him to take it and hand it personally to the french emperor when dispatching balashev the emperor repeated to him the words that he would not make peace so long as a single armed enemy remained on russian soil and told him to transmit those words to napoleon alexander did not insert them in his letter to napoleon because with his characteristic tact he felt it would be injudicious to use them at a moment when a last attempt at reconciliation was being made but he definitely instructed balashev to repeat them personally to napoleon having set off in the small hours of the fourteenth accompanied by a bugler and two cossacks balashev reached the french outposts at the village of rykonty on the russian side of the niemen by dawn there he was stopped by french cavalry sentinels a french noncommissioned officer of hussars in crimson uniform and a shaggy cap shouted to the approaching balashev to halt balashev did not do so at once but continued to advance along the road at a walking pace the noncommissioned officer frowned and muttering words of abuse advanced his horses chest against balashev put his hand to his saber and shouted rudely at the russian general asking was he deaf that he did not do as he was told balashev mentioned who he was the noncommissioned officer began talking with his comrades about regimental matters without looking at the russian general after living at the seat of the highest authority and power after conversing with the emperor less than three hours before and in general being accustomed to the respect due to his rank in the service balashev found it very strange here on russian soil to encounter this hostile and still more this disrespectful application of brute force to himself the sun was only just appearing from behind the clouds the air was fresh and dewy a herd of cattle was being driven along the road from the village and over the fields the larks rose trilling one after another like bubbles rising in water balashev looked around him awaiting the arrival of an officer from the village the russian cossacks and bugler and the french hussars looked silently at one another from time to time a french colonel of hussars who had evidently just left his bed came riding from the village on a handsome sleek gray horse accompanied by two hussars the officer the soldiers and their horses all looked smart and well kept it was that first period of a campaign when troops are still in full trim almost like that of peacetime maneuvers but with a shade of martial swagger in their clothes and a touch of the gaiety and spirit of enterprise which always accompany the opening of a campaign the french colonel with difficulty repressed a yawn but was polite and evidently understood balashevs importance he led him past his soldiers and behind the outposts and told him that his wish to be presented to the emperor would most likely be satisfied immediately as the emperors quarters were he believed not far off they rode through the village of rykonty past tethered french hussar horses past sentinels and men who saluted their colonel and stared with curiosity at a russian uniform and came out at the other end of the village the colonel said that the commander of the division was a mile and a quarter away and would receive balashev and conduct him to his destination the sun had by now risen and shone gaily on the bright verdure they had hardly ridden up a hill past a tavern before they saw a group of horsemen coming toward them in front of the group on a black horse with trappings that glittered in the sun rode a tall man with plumes in his hat and black hair curling down to his shoulders he wore a red mantle and stretched his long legs forward in french fashion this man rode toward balashev at a gallop his plumes flowing and his gems and gold lace glittering in the bright june sunshine balashev was only two horses length from the equestrian with the bracelets plunies necklaces and gold embroidery who was galloping toward him with a theatrically solemn countenance when julner the french colonel whispered respectfully the king of naples it was in fact murat now called king of naples though it was quite incomprehensible why he should be king of naples he was called so and was himself convinced that he was so and therefore assumed a more solemn and important air than formerly he was so sure that he really was the king of naples that when on the eve of his departure from that city while walking through the streets with his wife some italians called out to him viva il re he turned to his wife with a pensive smile and said poor fellows they dont know that i am leaving them tomorrow long live the king but though he firmly believed himself to be king of naples and pitied the grief felt by the subjects he was abandoning latterly after he had been ordered to return to military serviceand especially since his last interview with napoleon in danzig when his august brotherinlaw had told him i made you king that you should reign in my way but not in yourshe had cheerfully taken up his familiar business andlike a wellfed but not overfat horse that feels himself in harness and grows skittish between the shaftshe dressed up in clothes as variegated and expensive as possible and gaily and contentedly galloped along the roads of poland without himself knowing why or whither on seeing the russian general he threw back his head with its long hair curling to his shoulders in a majestically royal manner and looked inquiringly at the french colonel the colonel respectfully informed his majesty of balashevs mission whose name he could not pronounce de balmacheve said the king overcoming by his assurance the difficulty that had presented itself to the colonel charmed to make your acquaintance general he added with a gesture of kingly condescension as soon as the king began to speak loud and fast his royal dignity instantly forsook him and without noticing it he passed into his natural tone of goodnatured familiarity he laid his hand on the withers of balashevs horse and said well general it all looks like war as if regretting a circumstance of which he was unable to judge your majesty replied balashev my master the emperor does not desire war and as your majesty sees said balashev using the words your majesty at every opportunity with the affectation unavoidable in frequently addressing one to whom the title was still a novelty murats face beamed with stupid satisfaction as he listened to monsieur de balmacheve but royaute oblige and he felt it incumbent on him as a king and an ally to confer on state affairs with alexanders envoy he dismounted took balashevs arm and moving a few steps away from his suite which waited respectfully began to pace up and down with him trying to speak significantly he referred to the fact that the emperor napoleon had resented the demand that he should withdraw his troops from prussia especially when that demand became generally known and the dignity of france was thereby offended royalty has its obligations balashev replied that there was nothing offensive in the demand because but murat interrupted him then you dont consider the emperor alexander the aggressor he asked unexpectedly with a kindly and foolish smile balashev told him why he considered napoleon to be the originator of the war oh my dear general murat again interrupted him with all my heart i wish the emperors may arrange the affair between them and that the war begun by no wish of mine may finish as quickly as possible said he in the tone of a servant who wants to remain good friends with another despite a quarrel between their masters and he went on to inquiries about the grand duke and the state of his health and to reminiscences of the gay and amusing times he had spent with him in naples then suddenly as if remembering his royal dignity murat solemnly drew himself up assumed the pose in which he had stood at his coronation and waving his right arm said i wont detain you longer general i wish success to your mission and with his embroidered red mantle his flowing feathers and his glittering ornaments he rejoined his suite who were respectfully awaiting him balashev rode on supposing from murats words that he would very soon be brought before napoleon himself but instead of that at the next village the sentinels of davouts infantry corps detained him as the pickets of the vanguard had done and an adjutant of the corps commander who was fetched conducted him into the village to marshal davout chapter v davout was to napoleon what arakcheev was to alexanderthough not a coward like arakcheev he was as precise as cruel and as unable to express his devotion to his monarch except by cruelty in the organism of states such men are necessary as wolves are necessary in the organism of nature and they always exist always appear and hold their own however incongruous their presence and their proximity to the head of the government may be this inevitability alone can explain how the cruel arakcheev who tore out a grenadiers mustache with his own hands whose weak nerves rendered him unable to face danger and who was neither an educated man nor a courtier was able to maintain his powerful position with alexander whose own character was chivalrous noble and gentle balashev found davout seated on a barrel in the shed of a peasants hut writinghe was auditing accounts better quarters could have been found him but marshal davout was one of those men who purposely put themselves in most depressing conditions to have a justification for being gloomy for the same reason they are always hard at work and in a hurry how can i think of the bright side of life when as you see i am sitting on a barrel and working in a dirty shed the expression of his face seemed to say the chief pleasure and necessity of such men when they encounter anyone who shows animation is to flaunt their own dreary persistent activity davout allowed himself that pleasure when balashev was brought in he became still more absorbed in his task when the russian general entered and after glancing over his spectacles at balashevs face which was animated by the beauty of the morning and by his talk with murat he did not rise or even stir but scowled still more and sneered malevolently when he noticed in balashevs face the disagreeable impression this reception produced davout raised his head and coldly asked what he wanted thinking he could have been received in such a manner only because davout did not know that he was adjutant general to the emperor alexander and even his envoy to napoleon balashev hastened to inform him of his rank and mission contrary to his expectation davout after hearing him became still surlier and ruder where is your dispatch he inquired give it to me i will send it to the emperor balashev replied that he had been ordered to hand it personally to the emperor your emperors orders are obeyed in your army but here said davout you must do as youre told and as if to make the russian general still more conscious of his dependence on brute force davout sent an adjutant to call the officer on duty balashev took out the packet containing the emperors letter and laid it on the table made of a door with its hinges still hanging on it laid across two barrels davout took the packet and read the inscription you are perfectly at liberty to treat me with respect or not protested balashev but permit me to observe that i have the honor to be adjutant general to his majesty davout glanced at him silently and plainly derived pleasure from the signs of agitation and confusion which appeared on balashevs face you will be treated as is fitting said he and putting the packet in his pocket left the shed a minute later the marshals adjutant de castres came in and conducted balashev to the quarters assigned him that day he dined with the marshal at the same board on the barrels next day davout rode out early and after asking balashev to come to him peremptorily requested him to remain there to move on with the baggage train should orders come for it to move and to talk to no one except monsieur de castres after four days of solitude ennui and consciousness of his impotence and insignificanceparticularly acute by contrast with the sphere of power in which he had so lately movedand after several marches with the marshals baggage and the french army which occupied the whole district balashev was brought to vilnanow occupied by the frenchthrough the very gate by which he had left it four days previously next day the imperial gentlemaninwaiting the comte de turenne came to balashev and informed him of the emperor napoleons wish to honor him with an audience four days before sentinels of the preobrazhensk regiment had stood in front of the house to which balashev was conducted and now two french grenadiers stood there in blue uniforms unfastened in front and with shaggy caps on their heads and an escort of hussars and uhlans and a brilliant suite of aidesdecamp pages and generals who were waiting for napoleon to come out were standing at the porch round his saddle horse and his mameluke rustan napoleon received balashev in the very house in vilna from which alexander had dispatched him on his mission chapter vi though balashev was used to imperial pomp he was amazed at the luxury and magnificence of napoleons court the comte de turenne showed him into a big reception room where many generals gentlemeninwaiting and polish magnatesseveral of whom balashev had seen at the court of the emperor of russiawere waiting duroc said that napoleon would receive the russian general before going for his ride after some minutes the gentlemaninwaiting who was on duty came into the great reception room and bowing politely asked balashev to follow him balashev went into a small reception room one door of which led into a study the very one from which the russian emperor had dispatched him on his mission he stood a minute or two waiting he heard hurried footsteps beyond the door both halves of it were opened rapidly all was silent and then from the study the sound was heard of other steps firm and resolutethey were those of napoleon he had just finished dressing for his ride and wore a blue uniform opening in front over a white waistcoat so long that it covered his rotund stomach white leather breeches tightly fitting the fat thighs of his short legs and hessian boots his short hair had evidently just been brushed but one lock hung down in the middle of his broad forehead his plump white neck stood out sharply above the black collar of his uniform and he smelled of eau de cologne his full face rather younglooking with its prominent chin wore a gracious and majestic expression of imperial welcome he entered briskly with a jerk at every step and his head slightly thrown back his whole short corpulent figure with broad thick shoulders and chest and stomach involuntarily protruding had that imposing and stately appearance one sees in men of forty who live in comfort it was evident too that he was in the best of spirits that day he nodded in answer to balashavs low and respectful bow and coming up to him at once began speaking like a man who values every moment of his time and does not condescend to prepare what he has to say but is sure he will always say the right thing and say it well good day general said he i have received the letter you brought from the emperor alexander and am very glad to see you he glanced with his large eyes into balashavs face and immediately looked past him it was plain that balashevs personality did not interest him at all evidently only what took place within his own mind interested him nothing outside himself had any significance for him because everything in the world it seemed to him depended entirely on his will i do not and did not desire war he continued but it has been forced on me even now he emphasized the word i am ready to receive any explanations you can give me and he began clearly and concisely to explain his reasons for dissatisfaction with the russian government judging by the calmly moderate and amicable tone in which the french emperor spoke balashev was firmly persuaded that he wished for peace and intended to enter into negotiations when napoleon having finished speaking looked inquiringly at the russian envoy balashev began a speech he had prepared long before sire the emperor my master but the sight of the emperors eyes bent on him confused him you are flurriedcompose yourself napoleon seemed to say as with a scarcely perceptible smile he looked at balashevs uniform and sword balashev recovered himself and began to speak he said that the emperor alexander did not consider kurakins demand for his passports a sufficient cause for war that kurakin had acted on his own initiative and without his sovereigns assent that the emperor alexander did not desire war and had no relations with england not yet interposed napoleon and as if fearing to give vent to his feelings he frowned and nodded slightly as a sign that balashev might proceed after saying all he had been instructed to say balashev added that the emperor alexander wished for peace but would not enter into negotiations except on condition that here balashev hesitated he remembered the words the emperor alexander had not written in his letter but had specially inserted in the rescript to saltykov and had told balashev to repeat to napoleon balashev remembered these words so long as a single armed foe remains on russian soil but some complex feeling restrained him he could not utter them though he wished to do so he grew confused and said on condition that the french army retires beyond the niemen napoleon noticed balashevs embarrassment when uttering these last words his face twitched and the calf of his left leg began to quiver rhythmically without moving from where he stood he began speaking in a louder tone and more hurriedly than before during the speech that followed balashev who more than once lowered his eyes involuntarily noticed the quivering of napoleons left leg which increased the more napoleon raised his voice i desire peace no less than the emperor alexander he began have i not for eighteen months been doing everything to obtain it i have waited eighteen months for explanations but in order to begin negotiations what is demanded of me he said frowning and making an energetic gesture of inquiry with his small white plump hand the withdrawal of your army beyond the niemen sire replied balashev the niemen repeated napoleon so now you want me to retire beyond the niemenonly the niemen repeated napoleon looking straight at balashev the latter bowed his head respectfully instead of the demand of four months earlier to withdraw from pomerania only a withdrawal beyond the niemen was now demanded napoleon turned quickly and began to pace the room you say the demand now is that i am to withdraw beyond the niemen before commencing negotiations but in just the same way two months ago the demand was that i should withdraw beyond the vistula and the oder and yet you are willing to negotiate he went in silence from one corner of the room to the other and again stopped in front of balashev balashev noticed that his left leg was quivering faster than before and his face seemed petrified in its stern expression this quivering of his left leg was a thing napoleon was conscious of the vibration of my left calf is a great sign with me he remarked at a later date such demands as to retreat beyond the vistula and oder may be made to a prince of baden but not to me napoleon almost screamed quite to his own surprise if you gave me petersburg and moscow i could not accept such conditions you say i have begun this war but who first joined his army the emperor alexander not i and you offer me negotiations when i have expended millions when you are in alliance with england and when your position is a bad one you offer me negotiations but what is the aim of your alliance with england what has she given you he continued hurriedly evidently no longer trying to show the advantages of peace and discuss its possibility but only to prove his own rectitude and power and alexanders errors and duplicity the commencement of his speech had obviously been made with the intention of demonstrating the advantages of his position and showing that he was nevertheless willing to negotiate but he had begun talking and the more he talked the less could he control his words the whole purport of his remarks now was evidently to exalt himself and insult alexanderjust what he had least desired at the commencement of the interview i hear you have made peace with turkey balashev bowed his head affirmatively peace has been concluded he began but napoleon did not let him speak he evidently wanted to do all the talking himself and continued to talk with the sort of eloquence and unrestrained irritability to which spoiled people are so prone yes i know you have made peace with the turks without obtaining moldavia and wallachia i would have given your sovereign those provinces as i gave him finland yes he went on i promised and would have given the emperor alexander moldavia and wallachia and now he wont have those splendid provinces yet he might have united them to his empire and in a single reign would have extended russia from the gulf of bothnia to the mouths of the danube catherine the great could not have done more said napoleon growing more and more excited as he paced up and down the room repeating to balashev almost the very words he had used to alexander himself at tilsit all that he would have owed to my friendship oh what a splendid reign he repeated several times then paused drew from his pocket a gold snuffbox lifted it to his nose and greedily sniffed at it what a splendid reign the emperor alexanders might have been he looked compassionately at balashev and as soon as the latter tried to make some rejoinder hastily interrupted him what could he wish or look for that he would not have obtained through my friendship demanded napoleon shrugging his shoulders in perplexity but no he has preferred to surround himself with my enemies and with whom with steins armfeldts bennigsens and wintzingerodes stein a traitor expelled from his own country armfeldt a rake and an intriguer wintzingerode a fugitive french subject bennigsen rather more of a soldier than the others but all the same an incompetent who was unable to do anything in 1807 and who should awaken terrible memories in the emperor alexanders mind granted that were they competent they might be made use of continued napoleonhardly able to keep pace in words with the rush of thoughts that incessantly sprang up proving how right and strong he was in his perception the two were one and the same but they are not even that they are neither fit for war nor peace barclay is said to be the most capable of them all but i cannot say so judging by his first movements and what are they doing all these courtiers pfuel proposes armfeldt disputes bennigsen considers and barclay called on to act does not know what to decide on and time passes bringing no result bagration alone is a military man hes stupid but he has experience a quick eye and resolution and what role is your young monarch playing in that monstrous crowd they compromise him and throw on him the responsibility for all that happens a sovereign should not be with the army unless he is a general said napoleon evidently uttering these words as a direct challenge to the emperor he knew how alexander desired to be a military commander the campaign began only a week ago and you havent even been able to defend vilna you are cut in two and have been driven out of the polish provinces your army is grumbling on the contrary your majesty said balashev hardly able to remember what had been said to him and following these verbal fireworks with difficulty the troops are burning with eagerness i know everything napoleon interrupted him i know everything i know the number of your battalions as exactly as i know my own you have not two hundred thousand men and i have three times that number i give you my word of honor said napoleon forgetting that his word of honor could carry no weighti give you my word of honor that i have five hundred and thirty thousand men this side of the vistula the turks will be of no use to you they are worth nothing and have shown it by making peace with you as for the swedesit is their fate to be governed by mad kings their king was insane and they changed him for anotherbernadotte who promptly went madfor no swede would ally himself with russia unless he were mad napoleon grinned maliciously and again raised his snuffbox to his nose balashev knew how to reply to each of napoleons remarks and would have done so he continually made the gesture of a man wishing to say something but napoleon always interrupted him to the alleged insanity of the swedes balashev wished to reply that when russia is on her side sweden is practically an island but napoleon gave an angry exclamation to drown his voice napoleon was in that state of irritability in which a man has to talk talk and talk merely to convince himself that he is in the right balashev began to feel uncomfortable as envoy he feared to demean his dignity and felt the necessity of replying but as a man he shrank before the transport of groundless wrath that had evidently seized napoleon he knew that none of the words now uttered by napoleon had any significance and that napoleon himself would be ashamed of them when he came to his senses balashev stood with downcast eyes looking at the movements of napoleons stout legs and trying to avoid meeting his eyes but what do i care about your allies said napoleon i have alliesthe poles there are eighty thousand of them and they fight like lions and there will be two hundred thousand of them and probably still more perturbed by the fact that he had uttered this obvious falsehood and that balashev still stood silently before him in the same attitude of submission to fate napoleon abruptly turned round drew close to balashevs face and gesticulating rapidly and energetically with his white hands almost shouted know that if you stir up prussia against me ill wipe it off the map of europe he declared his face pale and distorted by anger and he struck one of his small hands energetically with the other yes i will throw you back beyond the dvina and beyond the dnieper and will reerect against you that barrier which it was criminal and blind of europe to allow to be destroyed yes that is what will happen to you that is what you have gained by alienating me and he walked silently several times up and down the room his fat shoulders twitching he put his snuffbox into his waistcoat pocket took it out again lifted it several times to his nose and stopped in front of balashev he paused looked ironically straight into balashevs eyes and said in a quiet voice and yet what a splendid reign your master might have had balashev feeling it incumbent on him to reply said that from the russian side things did not appear in so gloomy a light napoleon was silent still looking derisively at him and evidently not listening to him balashev said that in russia the best results were expected from the war napoleon nodded condescendingly as if to say i know its your duty to say that but you dont believe it yourself i have convinced you when balashev had ended napoleon again took out his snuffbox sniffed at it and stamped his foot twice on the floor as a signal the door opened a gentlemaninwaiting bending respectfully handed the emperor his hat and gloves another brought him a pocket handkerchief napoleon without giving them a glance turned to balashev assure the emperor alexander from me said he taking his hat that i am as devoted to him as before i know him thoroughly and very highly esteem his lofty qualities i will detain you no longer general you shall receive my letter to the emperor and napoleon went quickly to the door everyone in the reception room rushed forward and descended the staircase chapter vii after all that napoleon had said to himthose bursts of anger and the last dryly spoken words i will detain you no longer general you shall receive my letter balashev felt convinced that napoleon would not wish to see him and would even avoid another meeting with himan insulted envoyespecially as he had witnessed his unseemly anger but to his surprise balashev received through duroc an invitation to dine with the emperor that day bessieres caulaincourt and berthier were present at that dinner napoleon met balashev cheerfully and amiably he not only showed no sign of constraint or selfreproach on account of his outburst that morning but on the contrary tried to reassure balashev it was evident that he had long been convinced that it was impossible for him to make a mistake and that in his perception whatever he did was right not because it harmonized with any idea of right and wrong but because he did it the emperor was in very good spirits after his ride through vilna where crowds of people had rapturously greeted and followed him from all the windows of the streets through which he rode rugs flags and his monogram were displayed and the polish ladies welcoming him waved their handkerchiefs to him at dinner having placed balashev beside him napoleon not only treated him amiably but behaved as if balashev were one of his own courtiers one of those who sympathized with his plans and ought to rejoice at his success in the course of conversation he mentioned moscow and questioned balashev about the russian capital not merely as an interested traveler asks about a new city he intends to visit but as if convinced that balashev as a russian must be flattered by his curiosity how many inhabitants are there in moscow how many houses is it true that moscow is called holy moscow how many churches are there in moscow he asked and receiving the reply that there were more than two hundred churches he remarked why such a quantity of churches the russians are very devout replied balashev but a large number of monasteries and churches is always a sign of the backwardness of a people said napoleon turning to caulaincourt for appreciation of this remark balashev respectfully ventured to disagree with the french emperor every country has its own character said he but nowhere in europe is there anything like that said napoleon i beg your majestys pardon returned balashev besides russia there is spain where there are also many churches and monasteries this reply of balashevs which hinted at the recent defeats of the french in spain was much appreciated when he related it at alexanders court but it was not much appreciated at napoleons dinner where it passed unnoticed the uninterested and perplexed faces of the marshals showed that they were puzzled as to what balashevs tone suggested if there is a point we dont see it or it is not at all witty their expressions seemed to say so little was his rejoinder appreciated that napoleon did not notice it at all and naively asked balashev through what towns the direct road from there to moscow passed balashev who was on the alert all through the dinner replied that just as all roads lead to rome so all roads lead to moscow there were many roads and among them the road through poltava which charles xii chose balashev involuntarily flushed with pleasure at the aptitude of this reply but hardly had he uttered the word poltava before caulaincourt began speaking of the badness of the road from petersburg to moscow and of his petersburg reminiscences after dinner they went to drink coffee in napoleons study which four days previously had been that of the emperor alexander napoleon sat down toying with his sevres coffee cup and motioned balashev to a chair beside him napoleon was in that wellknown afterdinner mood which more than any reasoned cause makes a man contented with himself and disposed to consider everyone his friend it seemed to him that he was surrounded by men who adored him and he felt convinced that after his dinner balashev too was his friend and worshiper napoleon turned to him with a pleasant though slightly ironic smile they tell me this is the room the emperor alexander occupied strange isnt it general he said evidently not doubting that this remark would be agreeable to his hearer since it went to prove his napoleons superiority to alexander balashev made no reply and bowed his head in silence yes four days ago in this room wintzingerode and stein were deliberating continued napoleon with the same derisive and selfconfident smile what i cant understand he went on is that the emperor alexander has surrounded himself with my personal enemies that i do not understand has he not thought that i may the same and he turned inquiringly to balashev and evidently this thought turned him back on to the track of his mornings anger which was still fresh in him and let him know that i will do so said napoleon rising and pushing his cup away with his hand ill drive all his wurttemberg baden and weimar relations out of germany yes ill drive them out let him prepare an asylum for them in russia balashev bowed his head with an air indicating that he would like to make his bow and leave and only listened because he could not help hearing what was said to him napoleon did not notice this expression he treated balashev not as an envoy from his enemy but as a man now fully devoted to him and who must rejoice at his former masters humiliation and why has the emperor alexander taken command of the armies what is the good of that war is my profession but his business is to reign and not to command armies why has he taken on himself such a responsibility again napoleon brought out his snuffbox paced several times up and down the room in silence and then suddenly and unexpectedly went up to balashev and with a slight smile as confidently quickly and simply as if he were doing something not merely important but pleasing to balashev he raised his hand to the fortyyearold russian generals face and taking him by the ear pulled it gently smiling with his lips only to have ones ear pulled by the emperor was considered the greatest honor and mark of favor at the french court well adorer and courtier of the emperor alexander why dont you say anything said he as if it was ridiculous in his presence to be the adorer and courtier of anyone but himself napoleon are the horses ready for the general he added with a slight inclination of his head in reply to balashevs bow let him have mine he has a long way to go the letter taken by balashev was the last napoleon sent to alexander every detail of the interview was communicated to the russian monarch and the war began chapter viii after his interview with pierre in moscow prince andrew went to petersburg on business as he told his family but really to meet anatole kuragin whom he felt it necessary to encounter on reaching petersburg he inquired for kuragin but the latter had already left the city pierre had warned his brotherinlaw that prince andrew was on his track anatole kuragin promptly obtained an appointment from the minister of war and went to join the army in moldavia while in petersburg prince andrew met kutuzov his former commander who was always well disposed toward him and kutuzov suggested that he should accompany him to the army in moldavia to which the old general had been appointed commander in chief so prince andrew having received an appointment on the headquarters staff left for turkey prince andrew did not think it proper to write and challenge kuragin he thought that if he challenged him without some fresh cause it might compromise the young countess rostova and so he wanted to meet kuragin personally in order to find a fresh pretext for a duel but he again failed to meet kuragin in turkey for soon after prince andrew arrived the latter returned to russia in a new country amid new conditions prince andrew found life easier to bear after his betrothed had broken faith with himwhich he felt the more acutely the more he tried to conceal its effectsthe surroundings in which he had been happy became trying to him and the freedom and independence he had once prized so highly were still more so not only could he no longer think the thoughts that had first come to him as he lay gazing at the sky on the field of austerlitz and had later enlarged upon with pierre and which had filled his solitude at bogucharovo and then in switzerland and rome but he even dreaded to recall them and the bright and boundless horizons they had revealed he was now concerned only with the nearest practical matters unrelated to his past interests and he seized on these the more eagerly the more those past interests were closed to him it was as if that lofty infinite canopy of heaven that had once towered above him had suddenly turned into a low solid vault that weighed him down in which all was clear but nothing eternal or mysterious of the activities that presented themselves to him army service was the simplest and most familiar as a general on duty on kutuzovs staff he applied himself to business with zeal and perseverance and surprised kutuzov by his willingness and accuracy in work not having found kuragin in turkey prince andrew did not think it necessary to rush back to russia after him but all the same he knew that however long it might be before he met kuragin despite his contempt for him and despite all the proofs he deduced to convince himself that it was not worth stooping to a conflict with himhe knew that when he did meet him he would not be able to resist calling him out any more than a ravenous man can help snatching at food and the consciousness that the insult was not yet avenged that his rancor was still unspent weighed on his heart and poisoned the artificial tranquillity which he managed to obtain in turkey by means of restless plodding and rather vainglorious and ambitious activity in the year 1812 when news of the war with napoleon reached bucharestwhere kutuzov had been living for two months passing his days and nights with a wallachian womanprince andrew asked kutuzov to transfer him to the western army kutuzov who was already weary of bolkonskis activity which seemed to reproach his own idleness very readily let him go and gave him a mission to barclay de tolly before joining the western army which was then in may encamped at drissa prince andrew visited bald hills which was directly on his way being only two miles off the smolensk highroad during the last three years there had been so many changes in his life he had thought felt and seen so much having traveled both in the east and the west that on reaching bald hills it struck him as strange and unexpected to find the way of life there unchanged and still the same in every detail he entered through the gates with their stone pillars and drove up the avenue leading to the house as if he were entering an enchanted sleeping castle the same old stateliness the same cleanliness the same stillness reigned there and inside there was the same furniture the same walls sounds and smell and the same timid faces only somewhat older princess mary was still the same timid plain maiden getting on in years uselessly and joylessly passing the best years of her life in fear and constant suffering mademoiselle bourienne was the same coquettish selfsatisfied girl enjoying every moment of her existence and full of joyous hopes for the future she had merely become more selfconfident prince andrew thought dessalles the tutor he had brought from switzerland was wearing a coat of russian cut and talking broken russian to the servants but was still the same narrowly intelligent conscientious and pedantic preceptor the old prince had changed in appearance only by the loss of a tooth which left a noticeable gap on one side of his mouth in character he was the same as ever only showing still more irritability and skepticism as to what was happening in the world little nicholas alone had changed he had grown become rosier had curly dark hair and when merry and laughing quite unconsciously lifted the upper lip of his pretty little mouth just as the little princess used to do he alone did not obey the law of immutability in the enchanted sleeping castle but though externally all remained as of old the inner relations of all these people had changed since prince andrew had seen them last the household was divided into two alien and hostile camps who changed their habits for his sake and only met because he was there to the one camp belonged the old prince madmoiselle bourienne and the architect to the other princess mary dessalles little nicholas and all the old nurses and maids during his stay at bald hills all the family dined together but they were ill at ease and prince andrew felt that he was a visitor for whose sake an exception was being made and that his presence made them all feel awkward involuntarily feeling this at dinner on the first day he was taciturn and the old prince noticing this also became morosely dumb and retired to his apartments directly after dinner in the evening when prince andrew went to him and trying to rouse him began to tell him of the young count kamenskys campaign the old prince began unexpectedly to talk about princess mary blaming her for her superstitions and her dislike of mademoiselle bourienne who he said was the only person really attached to him the old prince said that if he was ill it was only because of princess mary that she purposely worried and irritated him and that by indulgence and silly talk she was spoiling little prince nicholas the old prince knew very well that he tormented his daughter and that her life was very hard but he also knew that he could not help tormenting her and that she deserved it why does prince andrew who sees this say nothing to me about his sister does he think me a scoundrel or an old fool who without any reason keeps his own daughter at a distance and attaches this frenchwoman to himself he doesnt understand so i must explain it and he must hear me out thought the old prince and he began explaining why he could not put up with his daughters unreasonable character if you ask me said prince andrew without looking up he was censuring his father for the first time in his life i did not wish to speak about it but as you ask me i will give you my frank opinion if there is any misunderstanding and discord between you and mary i cant blame her for it at all i know how she loves and respects you since you ask me continued prince andrew becoming irritableas he was always liable to do of latei can only say that if there are any misunderstandings they are caused by that worthless woman who is not fit to be my sisters companion the old man at first stared fixedly at his son and an unnatural smile disclosed the fresh gap between his teeth to which prince andrew could not get accustomed what companion my dear boy eh youve already been talking it over eh father i did not want to judge said prince andrew in a hard and bitter tone but you challenged me and i have said and always shall say that mary is not to blame but those to blamethe one to blameis that frenchwoman ah he has passed judgment passed judgement said the old man in a low voice and as it seemed to prince andrew with some embarrassment but then he suddenly jumped up and cried be off be off let not a trace of you remain here prince andrew wished to leave at once but princess mary persuaded him to stay another day that day he did not see his father who did not leave his room and admitted no one but mademoiselle bourienne and tikhon but asked several times whether his son had gone next day before leaving prince andrew went to his sons rooms the boy curlyheaded like his mother and glowing with health sat on his knee and prince andrew began telling him the story of bluebeard but fell into a reverie without finishing the story he thought not of this pretty child his son whom he held on his knee but of himself he sought in himself either remorse for having angered his father or regret at leaving home for the first time in his life on bad terms with him and was horrified to find neither what meant still more to him was that he sought and did not find in himself the former tenderness for his son which he had hoped to reawaken by caressing the boy and taking him on his knee well go on said his son prince andrew without replying put him down from his knee and went out of the room as soon as prince andrew had given up his daily occupations and especially on returning to the old conditions of life amid which he had been happy weariness of life overcame him with its former intensity and he hastened to escape from these memories and to find some work as soon as possible so youve decided to go andrew asked his sister thank god that i can replied prince andrew i am very sorry you cant why do you say that replied princess mary why do you say that when you are going to this terrible war and he is so old mademoiselle bourienne says he has been asking about you considered it necessary to hear to the end probably to arouse the patriotism of the russian people another general stood in a martial pose crossing himself by shaking his hand in front of his chest while looking about him standing among the crowd of peasants pierre recognized several acquaintances among these notables but did not look at themhis whole attention was absorbed in watching the serious expression on the faces of the crowd of soldiers and militiamen who were all gazing eagerly at the icon as soon as the tired chanters who were singing the service for the twentieth time that day began lazily and mechanically to sing save from calamity thy servants o mother of god and the priest and deacon chimed in for to thee under god we all flee as to an inviolable bulwark and protection there again kindled in all those faces the same expression of consciousness of the solemnity of the impending moment that pierre had seen on the faces at the foot of the hill at mozhaysk and momentarily on many and many faces he had met that morning and heads were bowed more frequently and hair tossed back and sighs and the sound men made as they crossed themselves were heard the crowd round the icon suddenly parted and pressed against pierre someone a very important personage judging by the haste with which way was made for him was approaching the icon it was kutuzov who had been riding round the position and on his way back to tatarinova had stopped where the service was being held pierre recognized him at once by his peculiar figure which distinguished him from everybody else with a long overcoat on his his exceedingly stout roundshouldered body with uncovered white head and puffy face showing the white ball of the eye he had lost kutuzov walked with plunging swaying gait into the crowd and stopped behind the priest he crossed himself with an accustomed movement bent till he touched the ground with his hand and bowed his white head with a deep sigh behind kutuzov was bennigsen and the suite despite the presence of the commander in chief who attracted the attention of all the superior officers the militiamen and soldiers continued their prayers without looking at him when the service was over kutuzov stepped up to the icon sank heavily to his knees bowed to the ground and for a long time tried vainly to rise but could not do so on account of his weakness and weight his white head twitched with the effort at last he rose kissed the icon as a child does with naively pouting lips and again bowed till he touched the ground with his hand the other generals followed his example then the officers and after them with excited faces pressing on one another crowding panting and pushing scrambled the soldiers and militiamen chapter xxii staggering amid the crush pierre looked about him count peter kirilovich how did you get here said a voice pierre looked round boris drubetskoy brushing his knees with his hand he had probably soiled them when he too had knelt before the icon came up to him smiling boris was elegantly dressed with a slightly martial touch appropriate to a campaign he wore a long coat and like kutuzov had a whip slung across his shoulder meanwhile kutuzov had reached the village and seated himself in the shade of the nearest house on a bench which one cossack had run to fetch and another had hastily covered with a rug an immense and brilliant suite surrounded him the icon was carried further accompanied by the throng pierre stopped some thirty paces from kutuzov talking to boris he explained his wish to be present at the battle and to see the position this is what you must do said boris i will do the honors of the camp to you you will see everything best from where count bennigsen will be i am in attendance on him you know ill mention it to him but if you want to ride round the position come along with us we are just going to the left flank then when we get back do spend the night with me and well arrange a game of cards of course you know dmitri sergeevich those are his quarters and he pointed to the third house in the village of gorki but i should like to see the right flank they say its very strong said pierre i should like to start from the moskva river and ride round the whole position well you can do that later but the chief thing is the left flank yes yes but where is prince bolkonskis regiment can you point it out to me prince andrews we shall pass it and ill take you to him what about the left flank asked pierre to tell you the truth between ourselves god only knows what state our left flank is in said boris confidentially lowering his voice it is not at all what count bennigsen intended he meant to fortify that knoll quite differently but boris shrugged his shoulders his serene highness would not have it or someone persuaded him you see but boris did not finish for at that moment kaysarov kutuzovs adjutant came up to pierre ah kaysarov said boris addressing him with an unembarrassed smile i was just trying to explain our position to the count it is amazing how his serene highness could so the intentions of the french you mean the left flank asked kaysarov yes exactly the left flank is now extremely strong though kutuzov had dismissed all unnecessary men from the staff boris had contrived to remain at headquarters after the changes he had established himself with count bennigsen who like all on whom boris had been in attendance considered young prince drubetskoy an invaluable man in the higher command there were two sharply defined parties kutuzovs party and that of bennigsen the chief of staff boris belonged to the latter and no one else while showing servile respect to kutuzov could so create an impression that the old fellow was not much good and that bennigsen managed everything now the decisive moment of battle had come when kutuzov would be destroyed and the power pass to bennigsen or even if kutuzov won the battle it would be felt that everything was done by bennigsen in any case many great rewards would have to be given for tomorrows action and new men would come to the front so boris was full of nervous vivacity all day after kaysarov others whom pierre knew came up to him and he had not time to reply to all the questions about moscow that were showered upon him or to listen to all that was told him the faces all expressed animation and apprehension but it seemed to pierre that the cause of the excitement shown in some of these faces lay chiefly in questions of personal success his mind however was occupied by the different expression he saw on other facesan expression that spoke not of personal matters but of the universal questions of life and death kutuzov noticed pierres figure and the group gathered round him call him to me said kutuzov an adjutant told pierre of his serene highness wish and pierre went toward kutuzovs bench but a militiaman got there before him it was dolokhov how did that fellow get here asked pierre hes a creature that wriggles in anywhere was the answer he has been degraded you know now he wants to bob up again hes been proposing some scheme or other and has crawled into the enemys picket line at night hes a brave fellow pierre took off his hat and bowed respectfully to kutuzov i concluded that if i reported to your serene highness you might send me away or say that you knew what i was reporting but then i shouldnt lose anything dolokhov was saying yes yes at the battle of borodino napoleon shot at no one and killed no one that was all done by the soldiers therefore it was not he who killed people the french soldiers went to kill and be killed at the battle of borodino not because of napoleons orders but by their own volition the whole armyfrench italian german polish and dutchhungry ragged and weary of the campaign felt at the sight of an army blocking their road to moscow that the wine was drawn and must be drunk had napoleon then forbidden them to fight the russians they would have killed him and have proceeded to fight the russians because it was inevitable when they heard napoleons proclamation offering them as compensation for mutilation and death the words of posterity about their having been in the battle before moscow they cried vive lempereur just as they had cried vive lempereur at the sight of the portrait of the boy piercing the terrestrial globe with a toy stick and just as they would have cried vive lempereur at any nonsense that might be told them there was nothing left for them to do but cry vive lempereur and go to fight in order to get food and rest as conquerors in moscow so it was not because of napoleons commands that they killed their fellow men and it was not napoleon who directed the course of the battle for none of his orders were executed and during the battle he did not know what was going on before him so the way in which these people killed one another was not decided by napoleons will but occurred independently of him in accord with the will of hundreds of thousands of people who took part in the common action it only seemed to napoleon that it all took place by his will and so the question whether he had or had not a cold has no more historic interest than the cold of the least of the transport soldiers moreover the assertion made by various writers that his cold was the cause of his dispositions not being as well planned as on former occasions and of his orders during the battle not being as good as previously is quite baseless which again shows that napoleons cold on the twentysixth of august was unimportant the dispositions cited above are not at all worse but are even better than previous dispositions by which he had won victories his pseudoorders during the battle were also no worse than formerly but much the same as usual these dispositions and orders only seem worse than previous ones because the battle of borodino was the first napoleon did not win the profoundest and most excellent dispositions and orders seem very bad and every learned militarist criticizes them with looks of importance when they relate to a battle that has been lost and the very worst dispositions and orders seem very good and serious people fill whole volumes to demonstrate their merits when they relate to a battle that has been won the dispositions drawn up by weyrother for the battle of austerlitz were a model of perfection for that kind of composition but still they were criticizedcriticized for their very perfection for their excessive minuteness napoleon at the battle of borodino fulfilled his office as representative of authority as well as and even better than at other battles he did nothing harmful to the progress of the battle he inclined to the most reasonable opinions he made no confusion did not contradict himself did not get frightened or run away from the field of battle but with his great tact and military experience carried out his role of appearing to command calmly and with dignity chapter xxix on returning from a second inspection of the lines napoleon remarked the chessmen are set up the game will begin tomorrow having ordered punch and summoned de beausset he began to talk to him about paris and about some changes he meant to make the empress household surprising the prefect by his memory of minute details relating to the court he showed an interest in trifles joked about de beaussets love of travel and chatted carelessly as a famous selfconfident surgeon who knows his job does when turning up his sleeves and putting on his apron while a patient is being strapped to the operating table the matter is in my hands and is clear and definite in my head when the times comes to set to work i shall do it as no one else could but now i can jest and the more i jest and the calmer i am the more tranquil and confident you ought to be and the more amazed at my genius having finished his second glass of punch napoleon went to rest before the serious business which he considered awaited him next day he was so much interested in that task that he was unable to sleep and in spite of his cold which had grown worse from the dampness of the evening he went into the large division of the tent at three oclock in the morning loudly blowing his nose he asked whether the russians had not withdrawn and was told that the enemys fires were still in the same places he nodded approval the adjutant in attendance came into the tent well rapp do you think we shall do good business today napoleon asked him without doubt sire replied rapp napoleon looked at him do you remember sire what you did me the honor to say at smolensk continued rapp the wine is drawn and must be drunk napoleon frowned and sat silent for a long time leaning his head on his hand this poor army he suddenly remarked it has diminished greatly since smolensk fortune is frankly a courtesan rapp i have always said so and i am beginning to experience it but the guards rapp the guards are intact he remarked interrogatively yes sire replied rapp napoleon took a lozenge put it in his mouth and glanced at his watch he was not sleepy and it was still not nearly morning it was impossible to give further orders for the sake of killing time for the orders had all been given and were now being executed have the biscuits and rice been served out to the regiments of the guards asked napoleon sternly yes sire the rice too rapp replied that he had given the emperors order about the rice but napoleon shook his head in dissatisfaction as if not believing that his order had been executed an attendant came in with punch napoleon ordered another glass to be brought for rapp and silently sipped his own i have neither taste nor smell he remarked sniffing at his glass this cold is tiresome they talk about medicinewhat is the good of medicine when it cant cure a cold corvisart gave me these lozenges but they dont help at all what can doctors cure one cant cure anything our body is a machine for living it is organized for that it is its nature let life go on in it unhindered and let it defend itself it will do more than if you paralyze it by encumbering it with remedies our body is like a perfect watch that should go for a certain time watchmaker cannot open it he can only adjust it by fumbling and that blindfold yes our body is just a machine for living that is all and having entered on the path of definition of which he was fond napoleon suddenly and unexpectedly gave a new one do you know rapp what military art is asked he it is the art of being stronger than the enemy at a given moment thats all rapp made no reply tomorrow we shall have to deal with kutuzov said napoleon we shall see do you remember at braunau he commanded an army for three weeks and did not once mount a horse to inspect his entrenchments we shall see he looked at his watch it was still only four oclock he did not feel sleepy the punch was finished and there was still nothing to do he rose walked to and fro put on a warm overcoat and a hat and went out of the tent the night was dark and damp a scarcely perceptible moisture was descending from above near by the campfires were dimly burning among the french guards and in the distance those of the russian line shone through the smoke the weather was calm and the rustle and tramp of the french troops already beginning to move to take up their positions were clearly audible napoleon walked about in front of his tent looked at the fires and listened to these sounds and as he was passing a tall guardsman in a shaggy cap who was standing sentinel before his tent and had drawn himself up like a black pillar at sight of the emperor napoleon stopped in front of him what year did you enter the service he asked with that affectation of military bluntness and geniality with which he always addressed the soldiers the man answered the question ah one of the old ones has your regiment had its rice it has your majesty napoleon nodded and walked away at halfpast five napoleon rode to the village of shevardino it was growing light the sky was clearing only a single cloud lay in the east the abandoned campfires were burning themselves out in the faint morning light on the right a single deep report of a cannon resounded and died away in the prevailing silence some minutes passed a second and a third report shook the air then a fourth and a fifth boomed solemnly near by on the right the first shots had not yet ceased to reverberate before others rang out and yet more were heard mingling with and overtaking one another napoleon with his suite rode up to the shevardino redoubt where he dismounted the game had begun on returning to gorki after having seen prince andrew pierre ordered his groom to get the horses ready and to call him early in the morning and then immediately fell asleep behind a partition in a corner boris had given up to him before he was thoroughly awake next morning everybody had already left the hut the panes were rattling in the little windows and his groom was shaking him your excellency your excellency your excellency he kept repeating pertinaciously while he shook pierre by the shoulder without looking at him having apparently lost hope of getting him to wake up what has it begun is it time pierre asked waking up hear the firing said the groom a discharged soldier all the gentlemen have gone out and his serene highness himself rode past long ago pierre dressed hastily and ran out to the porch outside all was bright fresh dewy and cheerful the sun just bursting forth from behind a cloud that had concealed it was shining with rays still half broken by the clouds over the roofs of the street opposite on the dewbesprinkled dust of the road on the walls of the houses on the windows the fence and on pierres horses standing before the hut the roar of guns sounded more distinct outside an adjutant accompanied by a cossack passed by at a sharp trot its time count its time cried the adjutant telling the groom to follow him with the horses pierre went down the street to the knoll from which he had looked at the field of battle the day before a crowd of military men was assembled there members of the staff could be heard conversing in french and kutuzovs gray head in a white cap with a red band was visible his gray nape sunk between his shoulders he was looking through a field glass down the highroad before him mounting the steps to the knoll pierre looked at the scene before him spellbound by beauty it was the same panorama he had admired from that spot the day before but now the whole place was full of troops and covered by smoke clouds from the guns and the slanting rays of the bright sun rising slightly to the left behind pierre cast upon it through the clear morning air penetrating streaks of rosy golden tinted light and long dark shadows the forest at the farthest extremity of the panorama seemed carved in some precious stone of a yellowishgreen color its undulating outline was silhouetted against the horizon and was pierced beyond valuevo by the smolensk highroad crowded with troops nearer at hand glittered golden cornfields interspersed with copses there were troops to be seen everywhere in front and to the right and left all this was vivid majestic and unexpected but what impressed pierre most of all was the view of the battlefield itself of borodino and the hollows on both sides of the kolocha above the kolocha in borodino and on both sides of it especially to the left where the voyna flowing between its marshy banks falls into the kolocha a mist had spread which seemed to melt to dissolve and to become translucent when the brilliant sun appeared and magically colored and outlined everything the smoke of the guns mingled with this mist and over the whole expanse and through that mist the rays of the morning sun were reflected flashing back like lightning from the water from the dew and from the bayonets of the troops crowded together by the riverbanks and in borodino a white church could be seen through the mist and here and there the roofs of huts in borodino as well as dense masses of soldiers or green ammunition chests and ordnance and all this moved or seemed to move as the smoke and mist spread out over the whole space just as in the mistenveloped hollow near borodino so along the entire line outside and above it and especially in the woods and fields to the left in the valleys and on the summits of the high ground clouds of powder smoke seemed continually to spring up out of nothing now singly now several at a time some translucent others dense which swelling growing rolling and blending extended over the whole expanse these puffs of smoke and strange to say the sound of the firing produced the chief beauty of the spectacle puffsuddenly a round compact cloud of smoke was seen merging from violet into gray and milky white and boom came the report a second later puff puffand two clouds arose pushing one another and blending together and boom boom came the sounds confirming what the eye had seen pierre glanced round at the first cloud which he had seen as a round compact ball and in its place already were balloons of smoke floating to one side andpuff with a pausepuff puff three and then four more appeared and then from each with the same intervalboomboom boom came the fine firm precise sounds in reply it seemed as if those smoke clouds sometimes ran and sometimes stood still while woods fields and glittering bayonets ran past them from the left over fields and bushes those large balls of smoke were continually appearing followed by their solemn reports while nearer still in the hollows and woods there burst from the muskets small cloudlets that had no time to become balls but had their little echoes in just the same way trakhtatatakh came the frequent crackle of musketry but it was irregular and feeble in comparison with the reports of the cannon pierre wished to be there with that smoke those shining bayonets that movement and those sounds he turned to look at kutuzov and his suite to compare his impressions with those of others they were all looking at the field of battle as he was and as it seemed to him with the same feelings all their faces were now shining with that latent warmth of feeling pierre had noticed the day before and had fully understood after his talk with prince andrew go my dear fellow go and christ be with you kutuzov was saying to a general who stood beside him not taking his eye from the battlefield the general mounted a horse a cossack had brought him pierre went to his groom who was holding his horses and asking which was the quietest clambered onto it seized it by the mane and turning out his toes pressed his heels against its sides and feeling that his spectacles were slipping off but unable to let go of the mane and reins he galloped after the general causing the staff officers to smile as they watched him from the knoll the booming cannonade and the fusillade of musketry were growing more intense over the whole field especially to the left where bagrations fleches were but where pierre was the smoke of the firing made it almost impossible to distinguish anything moreover his whole attention was engrossed by watching the family circleseparated from all elseformed by the men in the battery his first unconscious feeling of joyful animation produced by the sights and sounds of the battlefield was now replaced by another especially since he had seen that soldier lying alone in the hayfield now seated on the slope of the trench he observed the faces of those around him by ten oclock some twenty men had already been carried away from the battery two guns were smashed and cannon balls fell more and more frequently on the battery and spent bullets buzzed and whistled around but the men in the battery seemed not to notice this and merry voices and jokes were heard on all sides officer sent to inspect the locality comes in and gives a report quite contrary to what was said by the officer previously sent and a spy a prisoner and a general who has been on reconnaissance all describe the position of the enemys army differently people accustomed to misunderstand or to forget these inevitable conditions of a commander in chiefs actions describe to us for instance the position of the army at fili and assume that the commander in chief could on the first of september quite freely decide whether to abandon moscow or defend it whereas with the russian army less than four miles from moscow no such question existed when had that question been settled at drissa and at smolensk and most palpably of all on the twentyfourth of august at shevardino and on the twentysixth at borodino and each day and hour and minute of the retreat from borodino to fili contrary said that all the icons had been taken out of the churches and everybody was to be ordered to leave some said there had been another battle after borodino at which the french had been routed while others on the contrary reported that the russian army bad been destroyed some talked about the moscow militia which preceded by the clergy would go to the three hills others whispered that augustin had been forbidden to leave that traitors had been seized that the peasants were rioting and robbing people on their way from moscow and so on but all this was only talk in reality though the council of fili at which it was decided to abandon moscow had not yet been held both those who went away and those who remained behind felt though they did not show it that moscow would certainly be abandoned and that they ought to get away as quickly as possible and save their belongings it was felt that everything would suddenly break up and change but up to the first of september nothing had done so as a criminal who is being led to execution knows that he must die immediately but yet looks about him and straightens the cap that is awry on his head so moscow involuntarily continued its wonted life though it knew that the time of its destruction was near when the conditions of life to which its people were accustomed to submit would be completely upset during the three days preceding the occupation of moscow the whole rostov family was absorbed in various activities the head of the family count ilya rostov continually drove about the city collecting the current rumors from all sides and gave superficial and hasty orders at home about the preparations for their departure the countess watched the things being packed was dissatisfied with everything was constantly in pursuit of petya who was always running away from her and was jealous of natasha with whom he spent all his time sonya alone directed the practical side of matters by getting things packed but of late sonya had been particularly sad and silent nicholas letter in which he mentioned princess mary had elicited in her presence joyous comments from the countess who saw an intervention of providence in this meeting of the princess and nicholas i was never pleased at bolkonskis engagement to natasha said the countess but i always wanted nicholas to marry the princess and had a presentiment that it would happen what a good thing it would be sonya felt that this was true that the only possibility of retrieving the rostovs affairs was by nicholas marrying a rich woman and that the princess was a good match it was very bitter for her but despite her grief or perhaps just because of it she took on herself all the difficult work of directing the storing and packing of their things and was busy for whole days the count and countess turned to her when they had any orders to give petya and natasha on the contrary far from helping their parents were generally a nuisance and a hindrance to everyone almost all day long the house resounded with their running feet their cries and their spontaneous laughter they laughed and were gay not because there was any reason to laugh but because gaiety and mirth were in their hearts and so everything that happened was a cause for gaiety and laughter to them petya was in high spirits because having left home a boy he had returned as everybody told him a fine young man because he was at home because he had left belaya tserkov where there was no hope of soon taking part in a battle and had come to moscow where there was to be fighting in a few days and chiefly because natasha whose lead he always followed was in high spirits natasha was gay because she had been sad too long and now nothing reminded her of the cause of her sadness and because she was feeling well she was also happy because she had someone to adore her the adoration of others was a lubricant the wheels of her machine needed to make them run freelyand petya adored her above all they were gay because there was a war near moscow there would be fighting at the town gates arms were being given out everybody was escapinggoing away somewhere and in general something extraordinary was happening and that is always exciting especially to the young chapter xiii on saturday the thirtyfirst of august everything in the rostovs house seemed topsyturvy all the doors were open all the furniture was being carried out or moved about and the mirrors and pictures had been taken down there were trunks in the rooms and hay wrapping paper and ropes were scattered about the peasants and house serfs carrying out the things were treading heavily on the parquet floors the yard was crowded with peasant carts some loaded high and already corded up others still empty the voices and footsteps of the many servants and of the peasants who had come with the carts resounded as they shouted to one another in the yard and in the house the count bad been out since morning the countess had a headache brought on by all the noise and turmoil and was lying down in the new sitting room with a vinegar compress on her head petya was not at home he had gone to visit a friend with whom he meant to obtain a transfer from the militia to the active army sonya was in the ballroom looking after the packing of the glass and china natasha was sitting on the floor of her dismantled room with dresses ribbons and scarves strewn all about her gazing fixedly at the floor and holding in her hands the old ball dress already out of fashion which she had worn at her first petersburg ball natasha was ashamed of doing nothing when everyone else was so busy and several times that morning had tried to set to work but her heart was not in it and she could not and did not know how to do anything except with all her heart and all her might for a while she had stood beside sonya while the china was being packed and tried to help but soon gave it up and went to her room to pack her own things at first she found it amusing to give away dresses and ribbons to the maids but when that was done and what was left had still to be packed she found it dull dunyasha you pack you will wont you dear and when dunyasha willingly promised to do it all for her natasha sat down on the floor took her old ball dress and fell into a reverie quite unrelated to what ought to have occupied her thoughts now she was roused from her reverie by the talk of the maids in the next room which was theirs and by the sound of their hurried footsteps going to the back porch natasha got up and looked out of the window an enormously long row of carts full of wounded men had stopped in the street the housekeeper the old nurse the cooks coachmen maids footmen postilions and scullions stood at the gate staring at the wounded natasha throwing a clean pocket handkerchief over her hair and holding an end of it in each hand went out into the street the former housekeeper old mavra kuzminichna had stepped out of the crowd by the gate gone up to a cart with a hood constructed of bast mats and was speaking to a pale young officer who lay inside natasha moved a few steps forward and stopped shyly still holding her handkerchief and listened to what the housekeeper was saying then you have nobody in moscow she was saying you would be more comfortable somewhere in a house in ours for instance the family are leaving i dont know if it would be allowed replied the officer in a weak voice here is our commanding officer ask him and he pointed to a stout major who was walking back along the street past the row of carts natasha glanced with frightened eyes at the face of the wounded officer and at once went to meet the major may the wounded men stay in our house she asked the major raised his hand to his cap with a smile which one do you want maamselle said he screwing up his eyes and smiling natasha quietly repeated her question and her face and whole manner were so serious though she was still holding the ends of her handkerchief that the major ceased smiling and after some reflection as if considering in how far the thing was possiblereplied in the affirmative oh yes why not they may he said with a slight inclination of her head natasha stepped back quickly to mavra kuzminichna who stood talking compassionately to the officer they may he says they may whispered natasha the cart in which the officer lay was turned into the rostovs yard and dozens of carts with wounded men began at the invitation of the townsfolk to turn into the yards and to draw up at the entrances of the houses in povarskaya street natasha was evidently pleased to be dealing with new people outside the ordinary routine of her life she and mavra kuzminichna tried to get as many of the wounded as possible into their yard your papa must be told though said mavra kuzminichna never mind never mind what does it matter for one day we can move into the drawing room they can have all our half of the house there now young lady you do take things into your head even if we put them into the wing the mens room or the nurses room we must ask permission well ill ask natasha ran into the house and went on tiptoe through the halfopen door into the sitting room where there was a smell of vinegar and hoffmans drops are you asleep mamma oh what sleep said the countess waking up just as she was dropping into a doze mamma darling said natasha kneeling by her mother and bringing her face close to her mothers i am sorry forgive me ill never do it again i woke you up mavra kuzminichna has sent me they have brought some wounded hereofficers will you let them come they have nowhere to go i knew youd let them come she said quickly all in one breath what officers whom have they brought i dont understand anything about it said the countess natasha laughed and the countess too smiled slightly i knew youd give permission so ill tell them and having kissed her mother natasha got up and went to the door in the hall she met her father who had returned with bad news weve stayed too long said the count with involuntary vexation the club is closed and the police are leaving papa is it all rightive invited some of the wounded into the house said natasha of course it is he answered absently thats not the point i beg you not to indulge in trifles now but to help to pack and tomorrow we must go go go and the count gave a similar order to the majordomo and the servants at dinner petya having returned home told them the news he had heard he said the people had been getting arms in the kremlin and that though rostopchins broadsheet had said that he would sound a call two or three days in advance the order had certainly already been given for everyone to go armed to the three hills tomorrow and that there would be a big battle there the countess looked with timid horror at her sons eager excited face as he said this she realized that if she said a word about his not going to the battle she knew he enjoyed the thought of the impending engagement he would say something about men honor and the fatherlandsomething senseless masculine and obstinate which there would be no contradicting and her plans would be spoiled and so hoping to arrange to leave before then and take petya with her as their protector and defender she did not answer him but after dinner called the count aside and implored him with tears to take her away quickly that very night if possible with a womans involuntary loving cunning she who till then had not shown any alarm said that she would die of fright if they did not leave that very night without any pretense she was now afraid of everything chapter xiv madame schoss who had been out to visit her daughter increased the countess fears still more by telling what she had seen at a spirit dealers in myasnitski street when returning by that street she had been unable to pass because of a drunken crowd rioting in front of the shop she had taken a cab and driven home by a side street and the cabman had told her that the people were breaking open the barrels at the drink store having received orders to do so after dinner the whole rostov household set to work with enthusiastic haste packing their belongings and preparing for their departure the old count suddenly setting to work kept passing from the yard to the house and back again shouting confused instructions to the hurrying people and flurrying them still more petya directed things in the yard sonya owing to the counts contradictory orders lost her head and did not know what to do the servants ran noisily about the house and yard shouting and disputing natasha with the ardor characteristic of all she did suddenly set to work too at first her intervention in the business of packing was received skeptically everybody expected some prank from her and did not wish to obey her but she resolutely and passionately demanded obedience grew angry and nearly cried because they did not heed her and at last succeeded in making them believe her her first exploit which cost her immense effort and established her authority was the packing of the carpets the count had valuable gobelin tapestries and persian carpets in the house when natasha set to work two cases were standing open in the ballroom one almost full up with crockery the other with carpets there was also much china standing on the tables and still more was being brought in from the storeroom a third case was needed and servants had gone to fetch it sonya wait a bitwell pack everything into these said natasha you cant miss we have tried to said the butlers assistant no wait a minute please and natasha began rapidly taking out of the case dishes and plates wrapped in paper the dishes must go in here among the carpets said she why its a mercy if we can get the carpets alone into three cases said the butlers assistant oh wait please and natasha began rapidly and deftly sorting out the things these arent needed said she putting aside some plates of kiev ware theseyes these must go among the carpets she said referring to the saxony china dishes dont natasha leave it alone well get it all packed urged sonya reproachfully what a young lady she is remarked the majordomo but natasha would not give in she turned everything out and began quickly repacking deciding that the inferior russian carpets and unnecessary crockery should not be taken at all when everything had been taken out of the cases they recommenced packing and it turned out that when the cheaper things not worth taking had nearly all been rejected the valuable ones really did all go into the two cases only the lid of the case containing the carpets would not shut down a few more things might have been taken out but natasha insisted on having her own way she packed repacked pressed made the butlers assistant and petyawhom she had drawn into the business of packingpress on the lid and made desperate efforts herself thats enough natasha said sonya i see you were right but just take out the top one i wont cried natasha with one hand bolding back the hair that hung over her perspiring face while with the other she pressed down the carpets now press petya press vasilich press hard she cried the carpets yielded and the lid closed natasha clapping her hands screamed with delight and tears fell from her eyes but this only lasted a moment she at once set to work afresh and they now trusted her completely the count was not angry even when they told him that natasha had countermanded an order of his and the servants now came to her to ask whether a cart was sufficiently loaded and whether it might be corded up thanks to natashas directions the work now went on expeditiously unnecessary things were left and the most valuable packed as compactly as possible but hard as they all worked till quite late that night they could not get everything packed the countess had fallen asleep and the count having put off their departure till next morning went to bed sonya and natasha slept in the sitting room without undressing that night another wounded man was driven down the povarskaya and mavra kuzminichna who was standing at the gate had him brought into the rostovs yard mavra kuzminichna concluded that he was a very important man he was being conveyed in a caleche with a raised hood and was quite covered by an apron on the box beside the driver sat a venerable old attendant a doctor and two soldiers followed the carriage in a cart please come in here the masters are going away and the whole house will be empty said the old woman to the old attendant well perhaps said he with a sigh we dont expect to get him home alive we have a house of our own in moscow but its a long way from here and theres nobody living in it do us the honor to come in theres plenty of everything in the masters house come in said mavra kuzminichna is he very ill she asked the attendant made a hopeless gesture we dont expect to get him home we must ask the doctor and the old servant got down from the box and went up to the cart all right said the doctor the old servant returned to the caleche looked into it shook his head disconsolately told the driver to turn into the yard and stopped beside mavra kuzminichna o lord jesus christ she murmured she invited them to take the wounded man into the house the masters wont object she said but they had to avoid carrying the man upstairs and so they took him into the wing and put him in the room that had been madame schoss this wounded man was prince andrew bolkonski chapter xv moscows last day had come it was a clear bright autumn day a sunday the church bells everywhere were ringing for service just as usual on sundays nobody seemed yet to realize what awaited the city only two things indicated the social condition of moscowthe rabble that is the poor people and the price of commodities an enormous crowd of factory hands house serfs and peasants with whom some officials seminarists and gentry were mingled had gone early that morning to the three hills having waited there for rostopchin who did not turn up they became convinced that moscow would be surrendered and then dispersed all about the town to the public houses and cookshops prices too that day indicated the state of affairs the price of weapons of gold of carts and horses kept rising but the value of paper money and city articles kept falling so that by midday there were instances of carters removing valuable goods such as cloth and receiving in payment a half of what they carted while peasant horses were fetching five hundred rubles each and furniture mirrors and bronzes were being given away for nothing in the rostovs staid oldfashioned house the dissolution of former conditions of life was but little noticeable as to the serfs the only indication was that three out of their huge retinue disappeared during the night but nothing was stolen and as to the value of their possessions the thirty peasant carts that had come in from their estates and which many people envied proved to be extremely valuable and they were offered enormous sums of money for them not only were huge sums offered for the horses and carts but on the previous evening and early in the morning of the first of september orderlies and servants sent by wounded officers came to the rostovs and wounded men dragged themselves there from the rostovs and from neighboring houses where they were accommodated entreating the servants to try to get them a lift out of moscow the majordomo to whom these entreaties were addressed though he was sorry for the wounded resolutely refused saying that he dare not even mention the matter to the count pity these wounded men as one might it was evident that if they were given one cart there would be no reason to refuse another or all the carts and ones own carriages as well thirty carts could not save all the wounded and in the general catastrophe one could not disregard oneself and ones own family so thought the majordomo on his masters behalf on waking up that morning count ilya rostov left his bedroom softly so as not to wake the countess who had fallen asleep only toward morning and came out to the porch in his lilac silk dressing gown in the yard stood the carts ready corded the carriages were at the front porch the majordomo stood at the porch talking to an elderly orderly and to a pale young officer with a bandaged arm on seeing the count the majordomo made a significant and stern gesture to them both to go away well vasilich is everything ready asked the count and stroking his bald head he looked goodnaturedly at the officer and the orderly and nodded to them he liked to see new faces we can harness at once your excellency well thats right as soon as the countess wakes well be off god willing what is it gentlemen he added turning to the officer are you staying in my house the officer came nearer and suddenly his face flushed crimson count be so good as to allow me for gods sake to get into some corner of one of your carts i have nothing here with me i shall be all right on a loaded cart before the officer had finished speaking the orderly made the same request on behalf of his master oh yes yes yes said the count hastily i shall be very pleased very pleased vasilich youll see to it just unload one or two carts well what of it do whats necessary said the count muttering some indefinite order but at the same moment an expression of warm gratitude on the officers face had already sealed the order the count looked around him in the yard at the gates at the window of the wings wounded officers and their orderlies were to be seen they were all looking at the count and moving toward the porch please step into the gallery your excellency said the majordomo what are your orders about the pictures the count went into the house with him repeating his order not to refuse the wounded who asked for a lift well never mind some of the things can be unloaded he added in a soft confidential voice as though afraid of being overheard at nine oclock the countess woke up and matrena timofeevna who had been her ladys maid before her marriage and now performed a sort of chief gendarmes duty for her came to say that madame schoss was much offended and the young ladies summer dresses could not be left behind on inquiry the countess learned that madame schoss was offended because her trunk had been taken down from its cart and all the loads were being uncorded and the luggage taken out of the carts to make room for wounded men whom the count in the simplicity of his heart had ordered that they should take with them the countess sent for her husband what is this my dear i hear that the luggage is being unloaded you know love i wanted to tell you countess dear an officer came to me to ask for a few carts for the wounded after all ours are things that can be bought but think what being left behind means to them really now in our own yardwe asked them in ourselves and there are officers among them you know i think my dear let them be taken wheres the hurry the count spoke timidly as he always did when talking of money matters the countess was accustomed to this tone as a precursor of news of something detrimental to the childrens interests such as the building of a new gallery or conservatory the inauguration of a private theater or an orchestra she was accustomed always to oppose anything announced in that timid tone and considered it her duty to do so she assumed her dolefully submissive manner and said to her husband listen to me count you have managed matters so that we are getting nothing for the house and now you wish to throw away all our all the childrens property you said yourself that we have a hundred thousand rubles worth of things in the house i dont consent my dear i dont do as you please its the governments business to look after the wounded they know that look at the lopukhins opposite they cleared out everything two days ago thats what other people do its only we who are such fools if you have no pity on me have some for the children flourishing his arms in despair the count left the room without replying papa what are you doing that for asked natasha who had followed him into her mothers room nothing what business is it of yours muttered the count angrily but i heard said natasha why does mamma object what business is it of yours cried the count natasha stepped up to the window and pondered papa heres berg coming to see us said she looking out of the window chapter xvi berg the rostovs soninlaw was already a colonel wearing the orders of vladimir and anna and he still filled the quiet and agreeable post of assistant to the head of the staff of the assistant commander of the first division of the second army on the first of september he had come to moscow from the army he had nothing to do in moscow but he had noticed that everyone in the army was asking for leave to visit moscow and had something to do there so he considered it necessary to ask for leave of absence for family and domestic reasons berg drove up to his fatherinlaws house in his spruce little trap with a pair of sleek roans exactly like those of a certain prince he looked attentively at the carts in the yard and while going up to the porch took out a clean pocket handkerchief and tied a knot in it from the anteroom berg ran with smooth though impatient steps into the drawing room where he embraced the count kissed the hands of natasha and sonya and hastened to inquire after mammas health health at a time like this said the count come tell us the news is the army retreating or will there be another battle god almighty alone can decide the fate of our fatherland papa said berg the army is burning with a spirit of heroism and the leaders so to say have now assembled in council no one knows what is coming but in general i can tell you papa that such a heroic spirit the truly antique valor of the russian army which theywhich it he corrected himself has shown or displayed in the battle of the twentysixththere are no words worthy to do it justice i tell you papa he smote himself on the breast as a general he had heard speaking had done but berg did it a trifle late for he should have struck his breast at the words russian army i tell you frankly that we the commanders far from having to urge the men on or anything of that kind could hardly restrain those those yes those exploits of antique valor he went on rapidly general barclay de tolly risked his life everywhere at the head of the troops i can assure you our corps was stationed on a hillside you can imagine and berg related all that he remembered of the various tales he had heard those days natasha watched him with an intent gaze that confused him as if she were trying to find in his face the answer to some question altogether such heroism as was displayed by the russian warriors cannot be imagined or adequately praised said berg glancing round at natasha and as if anxious to conciliate her replying to her intent look with a smile russia is not in moscow she lives in the hearts of her sons isnt it so papa said he just then the countess came in from the sitting room with a weary and dissatisfied expression berg hurriedly jumped up kissed her hand asked about her health and swaying his head from side to side to express sympathy remained standing beside her yes mamma i tell you sincerely that these are hard and sad times for every russian but why are you so anxious you have still time to get away i cant think what the servants are about said the countess turning to her husband i have just been told that nothing is ready yet somebody after all must see to things one misses mitenka at such times there wont be any end to it the count was about to say something but evidently restrained himself he got up from his chair and went to the door at that moment berg drew out his handkerchief as if to blow his nose and seeing the knot in it pondered shaking his head sadly and significantly and i have a great favor to ask of you papa said he hm said the count and stopped i was driving past yusupovs house just now said berg with a laugh when the steward a man i know ran out and asked me whether i wouldnt buy something i went in out of curiosity you know and there is a small chiffonier and a dressing table you know how dear vera wanted a chiffonier like that and how we had a dispute about it at the mention of the chiffonier and dressing table berg involuntarily changed his tone to one of pleasure at his admirable domestic arrangements and its such a beauty it pulls out and has a secret english drawer you know and dear vera has long wanted one i wish to give her a surprise you see i saw so many of those peasant carts in your yard please let me have one i will pay the man well and the count frowned and coughed ask the countess i dont give orders if its inconvenient please dont said berg only i so wanted it for dear veras sake oh go to the devil all of you to the devil the devil the devil cried the old count my heads in a whirl and he left the room the countess began to cry yes mamma yes these are very hard times said berg natasha left the room with her father and as if finding it difficult to reach some decision first followed him and then ran downstairs petya was in the porch engaged in giving out weapons to the servants who were to leave moscow the loaded carts were still standing in the yard two of them had been uncorded and a wounded officer was climbing into one of them helped by an orderly do you know what its about petya asked natasha she understood that he meant what were their parents quarreling about she did not answer its because papa wanted to give up all the carts to the wounded said petya vasilich told me i consider i consider natasha suddenly almost shouted turning her angry face to petya i consider it so horrid so abominable so i dont know what are we despicable germans her throat quivered with convulsive sobs and afraid of weakening and letting the force of her anger run to waste she turned and rushed headlong up the stairs berg was sitting beside the countess consoling her with the respectful attention of a relative the count pipe in hand was pacing up and down the room when natasha her face distorted by anger burst in like a tempest and approached her mother with rapid steps its horrid its abominable she screamed you cant possibly have ordered it berg and the countess looked at her perplexed and frightened the count stood still at the window and listened mamma its impossible see what is going on in the yard she cried they will be left whats the matter with you who are they what do you want why the wounded its impossible mamma its monstrous no mamma darling its not the thing please forgive me darling mamma what does it matter what we take away only look what is going on in the yard mamma its impossible the count stood by the window and listened without turning round suddenly he sniffed and put his face closer to the window the countess glanced at her daughter saw her face full of shame for her mother saw her agitation and understood why her husband did not turn to look at her now and she glanced round quite disconcerted oh do as you like am i hindering anyone she said not surrendering at once mamma darling forgive me but the countess pushed her daughter away and went up to her husband my dear you order what is right you know i dont understand about it said she dropping her eyes shamefacedly the eggs the eggs are teaching the hen muttered the count through tears of joy and he embraced his wife who was glad to hide her look of shame on his breast papa mamma may i see to it may i asked natasha we will still take all the most necessary things the count nodded affirmatively and natasha at the rapid pace at which she used to run when playing at tag ran through the ballroom to the anteroom and downstairs into the yard the servants gathered round natasha but could not believe the strange order she brought them until the count himself in his wifes name confirmed the order to give up all the carts to the wounded and take the trunks to the storerooms when they understood that order the servants set to work at this new task with pleasure and zeal it no longer seemed strange to them but on the contrary it seemed the only thing that could be done just as a quarter of an hour before it had not seemed strange to anyone that the wounded should be left behind and the goods carted away but that had seemed the only thing to do the whole household as if to atone for not having done it sooner set eagerly to work at the new task of placing the wounded in the carts the wounded dragged themselves out of their rooms and stood with pale but happy faces round the carts the news that carts were to be had spread to the neighboring houses from which wounded men began to come into the rostovs yard many of the wounded asked them not to unload the carts but only to let them sit on the top of the things but the work of unloading once started could not be arrested it seemed not to matter whether all or only half the things were left behind cases full of china bronzes pictures and mirrors that had been so carefully packed the night before now lay about the yard and still they went on searching for and finding possibilities of unloading this or that and letting the wounded have another and yet another cart we can take four more men said the steward they can have my trap or else what is to become of them let them have my wardrobe cart said the countess dunyasha can go with me in the carriage they unloaded the wardrobe cart and sent it to take wounded men from a house two doors off the whole household servants included was bright and animated natasha was in a state of rapturous excitement such as she had not known for a long time what could we fasten this onto asked the servants trying to fix a trunk on the narrow footboard behind a carriage we must keep at least one cart whats in it asked natasha the counts books leave it vasilich will put it away its not wanted the phaeton was full of people and there was a doubt as to where count peter could sit on the box youll sit on the box wont you petya cried natasha sonya too was busy all this time but the aim of her efforts was quite different from natashas she was putting away the things that had to be left behind and making a list of them as the countess wished and she tried to get as much taken away with them as possible chapter xvii before two oclock in the afternoon the rostovs four carriages packed full and with the horses harnessed stood at the front door one by one the carts with the wounded had moved out of the yard the caleche in which prince andrew was being taken attracted sonyas attention as it passed the front porch with the help of a maid she was arranging a seat for the countess in the huge high coach that stood at the entrance whose caleche is that she inquired leaning out of the carriage window why didnt you know miss replied the maid the wounded prince he spent the night in our house and is going with us but who is it whats his name its our intended that wasprince bolkonski himself they say he is dying replied the maid with a sigh sonya jumped out of the coach and ran to the countess the countess tired out and already dressed in shawl and bonnet for her journey was pacing up and down the drawing room waiting for the household to assemble for the usual silent prayer with closed doors before starting natasha was not in the room mamma said sonya prince andrew is here mortally wounded he is going with us the countess opened her eyes in dismay and seizing sonyas arm glanced around natasha she murmured at that moment this news had only one significance for both of them they knew their natasha and alarm as to what would happen if she heard this news stifled all sympathy for the man they both liked natasha does not know yet but he is going with us said sonya you say he is dying sonya nodded the countess put her arms around sonya and began to cry the ways of god are past finding out she thought feeling that the almighty hand hitherto unseen was becoming manifest in all that was now taking place well mamma everything is ready whats the matter asked natasha as with animated face she ran into the room nothing answered the countess if everything is ready let us start and the countess bent over her reticule to hide her agitated face sonya embraced natasha and kissed her natasha looked at her inquiringly what is it what has happened nothing no is it something very bad for me what is it persisted natasha with her quick intuition sonya sighed and made no reply the count petya madame schoss mavra kuzminichna and vasilich came into the drawing room and having closed the doors they all sat down and remained for some moments silently seated without looking at one another the count was the first to rise and with a loud sigh crossed himself before the icon all the others did the same then the count embraced mavra kuzminichna and vasilich who were to remain in moscow and while they caught at his hand and kissed his shoulder he patted their backs lightly with some vaguely affectionate and comforting words the countess went into the oratory and there sonya found her on her knees before the icons that had been left here and there hanging on the wall the most precious ones with which some family tradition was connected were being taken with them in the porch and in the yard the men whom petya had armed with swords and daggers with trousers tucked inside their high boots and with belts and girdles tightened were taking leave of those remaining behind as is always the case at a departure much had been forgotten or put in the wrong place and for a long time two menservants stood one on each side of the open door and the carriage steps waiting to help the countess in while maids rushed with cushions and bundles from the house to the carriages the caleche the phaeton and back again they always will forget everything said the countess dont you know i cant sit like that and dunyasha with clenched teeth without replying but with an aggrieved look on her face hastily got into the coach to rearrange the seat oh those servants said the count swaying his head efim the old coachman who was the only one the countess trusted to drive her sat perched up high on the box and did not so much as glance round at what was going on behind him from thirty years experience he knew it would be some time yet before the order be off in gods name would be given him and he knew that even when it was said he would be stopped once or twice more while they sent back to fetch something that had been forgotten and even after that he would again be stopped and the countess herself would lean out of the window and beg him for the love of heaven to drive carefully down the hill he knew all this and therefore waited calmly for what would happen with more patience than the horses especially the near one the chestnut falcon who was pawing the ground and champing his bit at last all were seated the carriage steps were folded and pulled up the door was shut somebody was sent for a traveling case and the countess leaned out and said what she had to say then efim deliberately doffed his hat and began crossing himself the postilion and all the other servants did the same off in gods name said efim putting on his hat start the postilion started the horses the off pole horse tugged at his collar the high springs creaked and the body of the coach swayed the footman sprang onto the box of the moving coach which jolted as it passed out of the yard onto the uneven roadway the other vehicles jolted in their turn and the procession of carriages moved up the street in the carriages the caleche and the phaeton all crossed themselves as they passed the church opposite the house those who were to remain in moscow walked on either side of the vehicles seeing the travelers off rarely had natasha experienced so joyful a feeling as now sitting in the carriage beside the countess and gazing at the slowly receding walls of forsaken agitated moscow occasionally she leaned out of the carriage window and looked back and then forward at the long train of wounded in front of them almost at the head of the line she could see the raised hood of prince andrews caleche she did not know who was in it but each time she looked at the procession her eyes sought that caleche she knew it was right in front in kudrino from the nikitski presnya and podnovinsk streets came several other trains of vehicles similar to the rostovs and as they passed along the sadovaya street the carriages and carts formed two rows abreast as they were going round the sukharev water tower natasha who was inquisitively and alertly scrutinizing the people driving or walking past suddenly cried out in joyful surprise dear me mamma sonya look its he who who look yes on my word its bezukhov said natasha putting her head out of the carriage and staring at a tall stout man in a coachmans long coat who from his manner of walking and moving was evidently a gentleman in disguise and who was passing under the arch of the sukharev tower accompanied by a small sallowfaced beardless old man in a frieze coat yes it really is bezukhov in a coachmans coat with a queerlooking old boy really said natasha look look no its not he how can you talk such nonsense mamma screamed natasha ill stake my head its he i assure you stop stop she cried to the coachman but the coachman could not stop for from the meshchanski street came more carts and carriages and the rostovs were being shouted at to move on and not block the way in fact however though now much farther off than before the rostovs all saw pierreor someone extraordinarily like himin a coachmans coat going down the street with head bent and a serious face beside a small beardless old man who looked like a footman that old man noticed a face thrust out of the carriage window gazing at them and respectfully touching pierres elbow said something to him and pointed to the carriage pierre evidently engrossed in thought could not at first understand him at length when he had understood and looked in the direction the old man indicated he recognized natasha and following his first impulse stepped instantly and rapidly toward the coach but having taken a dozen steps he seemed to remember something and stopped natashas face leaning out of the window beamed with quizzical kindliness peter kirilovich come here we have recognized you this is wonderful she cried holding out her hand to him what are you doing why are you like this pierre took her outstretched hand and kissed it awkwardly as he walked along beside her while the coach still moved on what is the matter count asked the countess in a surprised and commiserating tone what what why dont ask me said pierre and looked round at natasha whose radiant happy expressionof which he was conscious without looking at herfilled him with enchantment are you remaining in moscow then pierre hesitated in moscow he said in a questioning tone yes in moscow goodby ah if only i were a man id certainly stay with you how splendid said natasha mamma if youll let me ill stay pierre glanced absently at natasha and was about to say something but the countess interrupted him you were at the battle we heard yes i was pierre answered there will be another battle tomorrow he began but natasha interrupted him but what is the matter with you count you are not like yourself oh dont ask me dont ask me i dont know myself tomorrow but no goodby goodby he muttered its an awful time and dropping behind the carriage he stepped onto the pavement natasha continued to lean out of the window for a long time beaming at him with her kindly slightly quizzical happy smile chapter xviii for the last two days ever since leaving home pierre had been living in the empty house of his deceased benefactor bazdeev this is how it happened when he woke up on the morning after his return to moscow and his interview with count rostopchin he could not for some time make out where he was and what was expected of him when he was informed that among others awaiting him in his reception room there was a frenchman who had brought a letter from his wife the countess helene he felt suddenly overcome by that sense of confusion and hopelessness to which he was apt to succumb he felt that everything was now at an end all was in confusion and crumbling to pieces that nobody was right or wrong the future held nothing and there was no escape from this position smiling unnaturally and muttering to himself he first sat down on the sofa in an attitude of despair then rose went to the door of the reception room and peeped through the crack returned flourishing his arms and took up a book his majordomo came in a second time to say that the frenchman who had brought the letter from the countess was very anxious to see him if only for a minute and that someone from bazdeevs widow had called to ask pierre to take charge of her husbands books as she herself was leaving for the country oh yes in a minute wait or no no of course go and say i will come directly pierre replied to the majordomo but as soon as the man had left the room pierre took up his hat which was lying on the table and went out of his study by the other door there was no one in the passage he went along the whole length of this passage to the stairs and frowning and rubbing his forehead with both hands went down as far as the first landing the hall porter was standing at the front door from the landing where pierre stood there was a second staircase leading to the back entrance he went down that staircase and out into the yard no one had seen him but there were some carriages waiting and as soon as pierre stepped out of the gate the coachmen and the yard porter noticed him and raised their caps to him when he felt he was being looked at he behaved like an ostrich which hides its head in a bush in order not to be seen he hung his head and quickening his pace went down the street of all the affairs awaiting pierre that day the sorting of joseph bazdeevs books and papers appeared to him the most necessary he hired the first cab he met and told the driver to go to the patriarchs ponds where the widow bazdeevs house was continually turning round to look at the rows of loaded carts that were making their way from all sides out of moscow and balancing his bulky body so as not to slip out of the ramshackle old vehicle pierre experiencing the joyful feeling of a boy escaping from school began to talk to his driver the man told him that arms were being distributed today at the kremlin and that tomorrow everyone would be sent out beyond the three hills gates and a great battle would be fought there having reached the patriarchs ponds pierre found the bazdeevs house where he had not been for a long time past he went up to the gate gerasim that sallow beardless old man pierre had seen at torzhok five years before with joseph bazdeev came out in answer to his knock at home asked pierre owing to the present state of things sophia danilovna has gone to the torzhok estate with the children your excellency i will come in all the same i have to look through the books said pierre be so good as to step in makar alexeevich the brother of my late mastermay the kingdom of heaven be hishas remained here but he is in a weak state as you know said the old servant pierre knew that makar alexeevich was joseph bazdeevs halfinsane brother and a hard drinker yes yes i know let us go in said pierre and entered the house a tall baldheaded old man with a red nose wearing a dressing gown and with galoshes on his bare feet stood in the anteroom on seeing pierre he muttered something angrily and went away along the passage he was a very clever man but has now grown quite feeble as your honor sees said gerasim will you step into the study pierre nodded as it was sealed up so it has remained but sophia danilovna gave orders that if anyone should come from you they were to have the books pierre went into that gloomy study which he had entered with such trepidation in his benefactors lifetime the room dusty and untouched since the death of joseph bazdeev was now even gloomier gerasim opened one of the shutters and left the room on tiptoe pierre went round the study approached the cupboard in which the manuscripts were kept and took out what had once been one of the most important the holy of holies of the order this was the authentic scotch acts with bazdeevs notes and explanations he sat down at the dusty writing table and having laid the manuscripts before him opened them out closed them finally pushed them away and resting his head on his hand sank into meditation gerasim looked cautiously into the study several times and saw pierre always sitting in the same attitude more than two hours passed and gerasim took the liberty of making a slight noise at the door to attract his attention but pierre did not hear him is the cabman to be discharged your honor oh yes said pierre rousing himself and rising hurriedly look here he added taking gerasim by a button of his coat and looking down at the old man with moist shining and ecstatic eyes i say do you know that there is going to be a battle tomorrow we heard so replied the man i beg you not to tell anyone who i am and to do what i ask you yes your excellency replied gerasim will you have something to eat no but i want something else i want peasant clothes and a pistol said pierre unexpectedly blushing yes your excellency said gerasim after thinking for a moment all the rest of that day pierre spent alone in his benefactors study and gerasim heard him pacing restlessly from one corner to another and talking to himself and he spent the night on a bed made up for him there gerasim being a servant who in his time had seen many strange things accepted pierres taking up his residence in the house without surprise and seemed pleased to have someone to wait on that same eveningwithout even asking himself what they were wanted forhe procured a coachmans coat and cap for pierre and promised to get him the pistol next day makar alexeevich came twice that evening shuffling along in his galoshes as far as the door and stopped and looked ingratiatingly at pierre but as soon as pierre turned toward him he wrapped his dressing gown around him with a shamefaced and angry look and hurried away it was when pierre wearing the coachmans coat which gerasim had procured for him and had disinfected by steam was on his way with the old man to buy the pistol at the sukharev market that he met the rostovs chapter xix kutuzovs order to retreat through moscow to the ryazan road was issued at night on the first of september the first troops started at once and during the night they marched slowly and steadily without hurry at daybreak however those nearing the town at the dorogomilov bridge saw ahead of them masses of soldiers crowding and hurrying across the bridge ascending on the opposite side and blocking the streets and alleys while endless masses of troops were bearing down on them from behind and an unreasoning hurry and alarm overcame them they all rushed forward to the bridge onto it and to the fords and the boats kutuzov himself had driven round by side streets to the other side of moscow by ten oclock in the morning of the second of september only the rear guard remained in the dorogomilov suburb where they had ample room the main army was on the other side of moscow or beyond it at that very time at ten in the morning of the second of september napoleon was standing among his troops on the poklonny hill looking at the panorama spread out before him from the twentysixth of august to the second of september that is from the battle of borodino to the entry of the french into moscow during the whole of that agitating memorable week there had been the extraordinary autumn weather that always comes as a surprise when the sun hangs low and gives more heat than in spring when everything shines so brightly in the rare clear atmosphere that the eyes smart when the lungs are strengthened and refreshed by inhaling the aromatic autumn air when even the nights are warm and when in those dark warm nights golden stars startle and delight us continually by falling from the sky at ten in the morning of the second of september this weather still held the brightness of the morning was magical moscow seen from the poklonny hill lay spaciously spread out with her river her gardens and her churches and she seemed to be living her usual life her cupolas glittering like stars in the sunlight the view of the strange city with its peculiar architecture such as he had never seen before filled napoleon with the rather envious and uneasy curiosity men feel when they see an alien form of life that has no knowledge of them this city was evidently living with the full force of its own life by the indefinite signs which even at a distance distinguish a living body from a dead one napoleon from the poklonny hill perceived the throb of life in the town and felt as it were the breathing of that great and beautiful body every russian looking at moscow feels her to be a mother every foreigner who sees her even if ignorant of her significance as the mother city must feel her feminine character and napoleon felt it cette ville asiatique aux innombrables eglises moscou la sainte la voila done enfin cette fameuse ville il etait temps said he and dismounting he ordered a plan of moscow to be spread out before him and summoned lelorgne dideville the interpreter that asiatic city of the innumerable churches holy moscow here it is then at last that famous city it was high time a town captured by the enemy is like a maid who has lost her honor thought he he had said so to tuchkov at smolensk from that point of view he gazed at the oriental beauty he had not seen before it seemed strange to him that his longfelt wish which had seemed unattainable had at last been realized in the clear morning light he gazed now at the city and now at the plan considering its details and the assurance of possessing it agitated and awed him but could it be otherwise he thought here is this capital at my feet where is alexander now and of what is he thinking a strange beautiful and majestic city and a strange and majestic moment in what light must i appear to them thought he thinking of his troops here she is the reward for all those fainthearted men he reflected glancing at those near him and at the troops who were approaching and forming up one word from me one movement of my hand and that ancient capital of the tsars would perish but my clemency is always ready to descend upon the vanquished i must be magnanimous and truly great but no it cant be true that i am in moscow he suddenly thought yet here she is lying at my feet with her golden domes and crosses scintillating and twinkling in the sunshine but i shall spare her on the ancient monuments of barbarism and despotism i will inscribe great words of justice and mercy it is just this which alexander will feel most painfully i know him it seemed to napoleon that the chief import of what was taking place lay in the personal struggle between himself and alexander from the height of the kremlinyes there is the kremlin yesi will give them just laws i will teach them the meaning of true civilization i will make generations of boyars remember their conqueror with love i will tell the deputation that i did not and do not desire war that i have waged war only against the false policy of their court that i love and respect alexander and that in moscow i will accept terms of peace worthy of myself and of my people i do not wish to utilize the fortunes of war to humiliate an honored monarch boyars i will say to them i do not desire war i desire the peace and welfare of all my subjects however i know their presence will inspire me and i shall speak to them as i always do clearly impressively and majestically but can it be true that i am in moscow yes there she lies quon mamene les boyars said he to his suite bring the boyars to me a general with a brilliant suite galloped off at once to fetch the boyars two hours passed napoleon had lunched and was again standing in the same place on the poklonny hill awaiting the deputation his speech to the boyars had already taken definite shape in his imagination that speech was full of dignity and greatness as napoleon understood it he was himself carried away by the tone of magnanimity he intended to adopt toward moscow in his imagination he appointed days for assemblies at the palace of the tsars at which russian notables and his own would mingle he mentally appointed a governor one who would win the hearts of the people having learned that there were many charitable institutions in moscow he mentally decided that he would shower favors on them all he thought that as in africa he had to put on a burnoose and sit in a mosque so in moscow he must be beneficent like the tsars and in order finally to touch the hearts of the russiansand being like all frenchmen unable to imagine anything sentimental without a reference to ma chere ma tendre ma pauvre mere he decided that he would place an inscription on all these establishments in large letters this establishment is dedicated to my dear mother or no it should be simply maison de ma mere2 he concluded but am i really in moscow yes here it lies before me but why is the deputation from the city so long in appearing he wondered my dear my tender my poor mother 2 house of my mother meanwhile an agitated consultation was being carried on in whispers among his generals and marshals at the rear of his suite those sent to fetch the deputation had returned with the news that moscow was empty that everyone had left it the faces of those who were not conferring together were pale and perturbed they were not alarmed by the fact that moscow had been abandoned by its inhabitants grave as that fact seemed but by the question how to tell the emperorwithout putting him in the terrible position of appearing ridiculousthat he had been awaiting the boyars so long in vain that there were drunken mobs left in moscow but no one else some said that a deputation of some sort must be scraped together others disputed that opinion and maintained that the emperor should first be carefully and skillfully prepared and then told the truth he will have to be told all the same said some gentlemen of the suite but gentlemen the position was the more awkward because the emperor meditating upon his magnanimous plans was pacing patiently up and down before the outspread map occasionally glancing along the road to moscow from under his lifted hand with a bright and proud smile but its impossible declared the gentlemen of the suite shrugging their shoulders but not venturing to utter the implied word le ridicule at last the emperor tired of futile expectation his actors instinct suggesting to him that the sublime moment having been too long drawn out was beginning to lose its sublimity gave a sign with his hand a single report of a signaling gun followed and the troops who were already spread out on different sides of moscow moved into the city through tver kaluga and dorogomilov gates faster and faster vying with one another they moved at the double or at a trot vanishing amid the clouds of dust they raised and making the air ring with a deafening roar of mingling shouts drawn on by the movement of his troops napoleon rode with them as far as the dorogomilov gate but there again stopped and dismounting from his horse paced for a long time by the kammerkollezski rampart awaiting the deputation chapter xx meanwhile moscow was empty there were still people in it perhaps a fiftieth part of its former inhabitants had remained but it was empty it was empty in the sense that a dying queenless hive is empty in a queenless hive no life is left though to a superficial glance it seems as much alive as other hives the bees circle round a queenless hive in the hot beams of the midday sun as gaily as around the living hives from a distance it smells of honey like the others and bees fly in and out in the same way but one has only to observe that hive to realize that there is no longer any life in it the bees do not fly in the same way the smell and the sound that meet the beekeeper are not the same to the beekeepers tap on the wall of the sick hive instead of the former instant unanimous humming of tens of thousands of bees with their abdomens threateningly compressed and producing by the rapid vibration of their wings an aerial living sound the only reply is a disconnected buzzing from different parts of the deserted hive from the alighting board instead of the former spirituous fragrant smell of honey and venom and the warm whiffs of crowded life comes an odor of emptiness and decay mingling with the smell of honey there are no longer sentinels sounding the alarm with their abdomens raised and ready to die in defense of the hive there is no longer the measured quiet sound of throbbing activity like the sound of boiling water but diverse discordant sounds of disorder in and out of the hive long black robber bees smeared with honey fly timidly and shiftily they do not sting but crawl away from danger formerly only bees laden with honey flew into the hive and they flew out empty now they fly out laden the beekeeper opens the lower part of the hive and peers in instead of black glossy beestamed by toil clinging to one anothers legs and drawing out the wax with a ceaseless hum of labor that used to hang in long clusters down to the floor of the hive drowsy shriveled bees crawl about separately in various directions on the floor and walls of the hive instead of a neatly glued floor swept by the bees with the fanning of their wings there is a floor littered with bits of wax excrement dying bees scarcely moving their legs and dead ones that have not been cleared away the beekeeper opens the upper part of the hive and examines the super instead of serried rows of bees sealing up every gap in the combs and keeping the brood warm he sees the skillful complex structures of the combs but no longer in their former state of purity all is neglected and foul black robber bees are swiftly and stealthily prowling about the combs and the short home bees shriveled and listless as if they were old creep slowly about without trying to hinder the robbers having lost all motive and all sense of life drones bumblebees wasps and butterflies knock awkwardly against the walls of the hive in their flight here and there among the cells containing dead brood and honey an angry buzzing can sometimes be heard here and there a couple of bees by force of habit and custom cleaning out the brood cells with efforts beyond their strength laboriously drag away a dead bee or bumblebee without knowing why they do it in another corner two old bees are languidly fighting or cleaning themselves or feeding one another without themselves knowing whether they do it with friendly or hostile intent in a third place a crowd of bees crushing one another attack some victim and fight and smother it and the victim enfeebled or killed drops from above slowly and lightly as a feather among the heap of corpses the keeper opens the two center partitions to examine the brood cells in place of the former close dark circles formed by thousands of bees sitting back to back and guarding the high mystery of generation he sees hundreds of dull listless and sleepy shells of bees they have almost all died unawares sitting in the sanctuary they had guarded and which is now no more they reek of decay and death only a few of them still move rise and feebly fly to settle on the enemys hand lacking the spirit to die stinging him the rest are dead and fall as lightly as fish scales the beekeeper closes the hive chalks a mark on it and when he has time tears out its contents and burns it clean so in the same way moscow was empty when napoleon weary uneasy and morose paced up and down in front of the kammerkollezski rampart awaiting what to his mind was a necessary if but formal observance of the proprietiesa deputation in various corners of moscow there still remained a few people aimlessly moving about following their old habits and hardly aware of what they were doing when with due circumspection napoleon was informed that moscow was empty he looked angrily at his informant turned away and silently continued to walk to and fro my carriage he said he took his seat beside the aidedecamp on duty and drove into the suburb moscow deserted he said to himself what an incredible event he did not drive into the town but put up at an inn in the dorogomilov suburb the coup de theatre had not come off chapter xxi the russian troops were passing through moscow from two oclock at night till two in the afternoon and bore away with them the wounded and the last of the inhabitants who were leaving the greatest crush during the movement of the troops took place at the stone moskva and yauza bridges while the troops dividing into two parts when passing around the kremlin were thronging the moskva and the stone bridges a great many soldiers taking advantage of the stoppage and congestion turned back from the bridges and slipped stealthily and silently past the church of vasili the beatified and under the borovitski gate back up the hill to the red square where some instinct told them they could easily take things not belonging to them crowds of the kind seen at cheap sales filled all the passages and alleys of the bazaar but there were no dealers with voices of ingratiating affability inviting customers to enter there were no hawkers nor the usual motley crowd of female purchasersbut only soldiers in uniforms and overcoats though without muskets entering the bazaar emptyhanded and silently making their way out through its passages with bundles tradesmen and their assistants of whom there were but few moved about among the soldiers quite bewildered they unlocked their shops and locked them up again and themselves carried goods away with the help their assistants on the square in front of the bazaar were drummers beating the muster call but the roll of the drums did not make the looting soldiers run in the direction of the drum as formerly but made them on the contrary run farther away among the soldiers in the shops and passages some men were to be seen in gray coats with closely shaven heads two officers one with a scarf over his uniform and mounted on a lean darkgray horse the other in an overcoat and on foot stood at the corner of ilyinka street talking a third officer galloped up to them the general orders them all to be driven out at once without fail this is outrageous half the men have dispersed where are you off to where he shouted to three infantrymen without muskets who holding up the skirts of their overcoats were slipping past him into the bazaar passage stop you rascals but how are you going to stop them replied another officer there is no getting them together the army should push on before the rest bolt thats all how can one push on they are stuck there wedged on the bridge and dont move shouldnt we put a cordon round to prevent the rest from running away come go in there and drive them out shouted the senior officer the officer in the scarf dismounted called up a drummer and went with him into the arcade some soldiers started running away in a group a shopkeeper with red pimples on his cheeks near the nose and a calm persistent calculating expression on his plump face hurriedly and ostentatiously approached the officer swinging his arms your honor said he be so good as to protect us we wont grudge trifles you are welcome to anythingwe shall be delighted pray ill fetch a piece of cloth at once for such an honorable gentleman or even two pieces with pleasure for we feel how it is but whats all thissheer robbery if you please could not guards be placed if only to let us close the shop several shopkeepers crowded round the officer eh what twaddle said one of them a thin sternlooking man when ones head is gone one doesnt weep for ones hair take what any of you like and flourishing his arm energetically he turned sideways to the officer its all very well for you ivan sidorych to talk said the first tradesman angrily please step inside your honor talk indeed cried the thin one in my three shops here i have a hundred thousand rubles worth of goods can they be saved when the army has gone eh what people against gods might our hands cant fight come inside your honor repeated the tradesman bowing the officer stood perplexed and his face showed indecision its not my business he exclaimed and strode on quickly down one of the passages from one open shop came the sound of blows and vituperation and just as the officer came up to it a man in a gray coat with a shaven head was flung out violently this man bent double rushed past the tradesman and the officer the officer pounced on the soldiers who were in the shops but at that moment fearful screams reached them from the huge crowd on the moskva bridge and the officer ran out into the square what is it what is it he asked but his comrade was already galloping off past vasili the beatified in the direction from which the screams came the officer mounted his horse and rode after him when he reached the bridge he saw two unlimbered guns the infantry crossing the bridge several overturned carts and frightened and laughing faces among the troops beside the cannon a cart was standing to which two horses were harnessed four borzois with collars were pressing close to the wheels the cart was loaded high and at the very top beside a childs chair with its legs in the air sat a peasant woman uttering piercing and desperate shrieks he was told by his fellow officers that the screams of the crowd and the shrieks of the woman were due to the fact that general ermolov coming up to the crowd and learning that soldiers were dispersing among the shops while crowds of civilians blocked the bridge had ordered two guns to be unlimbered and made a show of firing at the bridge the crowd crushing one another upsetting carts and shouting and squeezing desperately had cleared off the bridge and the troops were now moving forward chapter xxii meanwhile the city itself was deserted there was hardly anyone in the streets the gates and shops were all closed only here and there round the taverns solitary shouts or drunken songs could be heard nobody drove through the streets and footsteps were rarely heard the povarskaya was quite still and deserted the huge courtyard of the rostovs house was littered with wisps of hay and with dung from the horses and not a soul was to be seen there in the great drawing room of the house which had been left with all it contained were two people they were the yard porter ignat and the page boy mishka vasilichs grandson who had stayed in moscow with his grandfather mishka had opened the clavichord and was strumming on it with one finger the yard porter his arms akimbo stood smiling with satisfaction before the large mirror isnt it fine eh uncle ignat said the boy suddenly beginning to strike the keyboard with both hands only fancy answered ignat surprised at the broadening grin on his face in the mirror impudence impudence they heard behind them the voice of mavra kuzminichna who had entered silently how hes grinning the fat mug is that what youre here for nothings cleared away down there and vasilich is worn out just you wait a bit ignat left off smiling adjusted his belt and went out of the room with meekly downcast eyes aunt i did it gently said the boy ill give you something gently you monkey you cried mavra kuzminichna raising her arm threateningly go and get the samovar to boil for your grandfather mavra kuzminichna flicked the dust off the clavichord and closed it and with a deep sigh left the drawing room and locked its main door going out into the yard she paused to consider where she should go nextto drink tea in the servants wing with vasilich or into the storeroom to put away what still lay about she heard the sound of quick footsteps in the quiet street someone stopped at the gate and the latch rattled as someone tried to open it mavra kuzminichna went to the gate who do you want the countcount ilya andreevich rostov and who are you an officer i have to see him came the reply in a pleasant wellbred russian voice mavra kuzminichna opened the gate and an officer of eighteen with the round face of a rostov entered the yard they have gone away sir went away yesterday at vespertime said mavra kuzminichna cordially the young officer standing in the gateway as if hesitating whether to enter or not clicked his tongue ah how annoying he muttered i should have come yesterday ah what a pity meanwhile mavra kuzminichna was attentively and sympathetically examining the familiar rostov features of the young mans face his tattered coat and troddendown boots what did you want to see the count for she asked oh well it cant be helped said he in a tone of vexation and placed his hand on the gate as if to leave he again paused in indecision you see he suddenly said i am a kinsman of the counts and he has been very kind to me as you see he glanced with an amused air and goodnatured smile at his coat and boots my things are worn out and i have no money so i was going to ask the count mavra kuzminichna did not let him finish just wait a minute sir one little moment said she and as soon as the officer let go of the gate handle she turned and hurrying away on her old legs went through the back yard to the servants quarters while mavra kuzminichna was running to her room the officer walked about the yard gazing at his wornout boots with lowered head and a faint smile on his lips what a pity ive missed uncle what a nice old woman where has she run off to and how am i to find the nearest way to overtake my regiment which must by now be getting near the rogozhski gate thought he just then mavra kuzminichna appeared from behind the corner of the house with a frightened yet resolute look carrying a rolledup check kerchief in her hand while still a few steps from the officer she unfolded the kerchief and took out of it a white twentyfiveruble assignat and hastily handed it to him if his excellency had been at home as a kinsman he would of course but as it is mavra kuzminichna grew abashed and confused the officer did not decline but took the note quietly and thanked her if the count had been at home mavra kuzminichna went on apologetically christ be with you sir may god preserve you said she bowing as she saw him out swaying his head and smiling as if amused at himself the officer ran almost at a trot through the deserted streets toward the yauza bridge to overtake his regiment but mavra kuzminichna stood at the closed gate for some time with moist eyes pensively swaying her head and feeling an unexpected flow of motherly tenderness and pity for the unknown young officer chapter xxiii from an unfinished house on the varvarka the ground floor of which was a dramshop came drunken shouts and songs on benches round the tables in a dirty little room sat some ten factory hands tipsy and perspiring with dim eyes and wideopen mouths they were all laboriously singing some song or other they were singing discordantly arduously and with great effort evidently not because they wished to sing but because they wanted to show they were drunk and on a spree one a tall fairhaired lad in a clean blue coat was standing over the others his face with its fine straight nose would have been handsome had it not been for his thin compressed twitching lips and dull gloomy fixed eyes evidently possessed by some idea he stood over those who were singing and solemnly and jerkily flourished above their heads his white arm with the sleeve turned up to the elbow trying unnaturally to spread out his dirty fingers the sleeve of his coat kept slipping down and he always carefully rolled it up again with his left hand as if it were most important that the sinewy white arm he was flourishing should be bare in the midst of the song cries were heard and fighting and blows in the passage and porch the tall lad waved his arm stop it he exclaimed peremptorily theres a fight lads and still rolling up his sleeve he went out to the porch the factory hands followed him these men who under the leadership of the tall lad were drinking in the dramshop that morning had brought the publican some skins from the factory and for this had had drink served them the blacksmiths from a neighboring smithy hearing the sounds of revelry in the tavern and supposing it to have been broken into wished to force their way in too and a fight in the porch had resulted the publican was fighting one of the smiths at the door and when the workmen came out the smith wrenching himself free from the tavern keeper fell face downward on the pavement another smith tried to enter the doorway pressing against the publican with his chest the lad with the turnedup sleeve gave the smith a blow in the face and cried wildly theyre fighting us lads at that moment the first smith got up and scratching his bruised face to make it bleed shouted in a tearful voice police murder theyve killed a man lads oh gracious me a man beaten to deathkilled screamed a woman coming out of a gate close by a crowd gathered round the bloodstained smith havent you robbed people enoughtaking their last shirts said a voice addressing the publican what have you killed a man for you thief the tall lad standing in the porch turned his bleared eyes from the publican to the smith and back again as if considering whom he ought to fight now murderer he shouted suddenly to the publican bind him lads i daresay you would like to bind me shouted the publican pushing away the men advancing on him and snatching his cap from his head he flung it on the ground as if this action had some mysterious and menacing significance the workmen surrounding the publican paused in indecision i know the law very well mates ill take the matter to the captain of police you think i wont get to him robbery is not permitted to anybody now a days shouted the publican picking up his cap come along then come along then the publican and the tall young fellow repeated one after the other and they moved up the street together the bloodstained smith went beside them the factory hands and others followed behind talking and shouting at the corner of the moroseyka opposite a large house with closed shutters and bearing a bootmakers signboard stood a score of thin wornout gloomyfaced bootmakers wearing overalls and long tattered coats he should pay folks off properly a thin workingman with frowning brows and a straggly beard was saying but hes sucked our blood and now he thinks hes quit of us hes been misleading us all the week and now that hes brought us to this pass hes made off on seeing the crowd and the bloodstained man the workman ceased speaking and with eager curiosity all the bootmakers joined the moving crowd where are all the folks going why to the police of course i say is it true that we have been beaten and what did you think look what folks are saying questions and answers were heard the publican taking advantage of the increased crowd dropped behind and returned to his tavern the tall youth not noticing the disappearance of his foe waved his bare arm and went on talking incessantly attracting general attention to himself it was around him that the people chiefly crowded expecting answers from him to the questions that occupied all their minds he must keep order keep the law thats what the government is there for am i not right good christians said the tall youth with a scarcely perceptible smile he thinks theres no government how can one do without government or else there would be plenty whod rob us why talk nonsense rejoined voices in the crowd will they give up moscow like this they told you that for fun and you believed it arent there plenty of troops on the march let him in indeed thats what the government is for youd better listen to what people are saying said some of the mob pointing to the tall youth by the wall of chinatown a smaller group of people were gathered round a man in a frieze coat who held a paper in his hand an ukase they are reading an ukase reading an ukase cried voices in the crowd and the people rushed toward the reader the man in the frieze coat was reading the broadsheet of august 31 when the crowd collected round him he seemed confused but at the demand of the tall lad who had pushed his way up to him he began in a rather tremulous voice to read the sheet from the beginning early tomorrow i shall go to his serene highness he read sirin highness said the tall fellow with a triumphant smile on his lips and a frown on his brow to consult with him to act and to aid the army to exterminate these scoundrels we too will take part the reader went on and then paused do you see shouted the youth victoriously hes going to clear up the whole affair for you in destroying them and will send these visitors to the devil i will come back to dinner and well set to work we will do completely do and undo these scoundrels the last words were read out in the midst of complete silence the tall lad hung his head gloomily it was evident that no one had understood the last part in particular the words i will come back to dinner evidently displeased both reader and audience the peoples minds were tuned to a high pitch and this was too simple and needlessly comprehensibleit was what any one of them might have said and therefore was what an ukase emanating from the highest authority should not say they all stood despondent and silent the tall youth moved his lips and swayed from side to side we should ask him thats he himself yes ask him indeed why not hell explain voices in the rear of the crowd were suddenly heard saying and the general attention turned to the police superintendents trap which drove into the square attended by two mounted dragoons the superintendent of police who had that morning by count rostopchins orders to burn the barges and had in connection with that matter acquired a large sum of money which was at that moment in his pocket on seeing a crowd bearing down upon him told his coachman to stop what people are these he shouted to the men who were moving singly and timidly in the direction of his trap what people are these he shouted again receiving no answer your honor replied the shopman in the frieze coat your honor in accord with the proclamation of his highest excellency the count they desire to serve not sparing their lives and it is not any kind of riot but as his highest excellence said the count has not left he is here and an order will be issued concerning you said the superintendent of police go on he ordered his coachman the crowd halted pressing around those who had heard what the superintendent had said and looking at the departing trap the superintendent of police turned round at that moment with a scared look said something to his coachman and his horses increased their speed its a fraud lads lead the way to him himself shouted the tall youth dont let him go lads let him answer us keep him shouted different people and the people dashed in pursuit of the trap following the superintendent of police and talking loudly the crowd went in the direction of the lubyanka street there now the gentry and merchants have gone away and left us to perish do they think were dogs voices in the crowd were heard saying more and more frequently chapter xxiv on the evening of the first of september after his interview with kutuzov count rostopchin had returned to moscow mortified and offended because he had not been invited to attend the council of war and because kutuzov had paid no attention to his offer to take part in the defense of the city amazed also at the novel outlook revealed to him at the camp which treated the tranquillity of the capital and its patriotic fervor as not merely secondary but quite irrelevant and unimportant matters distressed offended and surprised by all this rostopchin had returned to moscow after supper he lay down on a sofa without undressing and was awakened soon after midnight by a courier bringing him a letter from kutuzov this letter requested the count to send police officers to guide the troops through the town as the army was retreating to the ryazan road beyond moscow this was not news to rostopchin he had known that moscow would be abandoned not merely since his interview the previous day with kutuzov on the poklonny hill but ever since the battle of borodino for all the generals who came to moscow after that battle had said unanimously that it was impossible to fight another battle and since then the government property had been removed every night and half the inhabitants had left the city with rostopchins own permission yet all the same this information astonished and irritated the count coming as it did in the form of a simple note with an order from kutuzov and received at night breaking in on his beauty sleep when later on in his memoirs count rostopchin explained his actions at this time he repeatedly says that he was then actuated by two important considerations to maintain tranquillity in moscow and expedite the departure of the inhabitants if one accepts this twofold aim all rostopchins actions appear irreproachable why were the holy relics the arms ammunition gunpowder and stores of corn not removed why were thousands of inhabitants deceived into believing that moscow would not be given upand thereby ruined to presence the tranquillity of the city explains count rostopchin why were bundles of useless papers from the government offices and leppichs balloon and other articles removed to leave the town empty explains count rostopchin one need only admit that public tranquillity is in danger and any action finds a justification all the horrors of the reign of terror were based only on solicitude for public tranquillity on what then was count rostopchins fear for the tranquillity of moscow based in 1812 what reason was there for assuming any probability of an uprising in the city the inhabitants were leaving it and the retreating troops were filling it why should that cause the masses to riot neither in moscow nor anywhere in russia did anything resembling an insurrection ever occur when the enemy entered a town more than ten thousand people were still in moscow on the first and second of september and except for a mob in the governors courtyard assembled there at his bidding nothing happened it is obvious that there would have been even less reason to expect a disturbance among the people if after the battle of borodino when the surrender of moscow became certain or at least probable rostopchin instead of exciting the people by distributing arms and broadsheets had taken steps to remove all the holy relics the gunpowder munitions and money and had told the population plainly that the town would be abandoned rostopchin though he had patriotic sentiments was a sanguine and impulsive man who had always moved in the highest administrative circles and had no understanding at all of the people he supposed himself to be guiding ever since the enemys entry into smolensk he had in imagination been playing the role of director of the popular feeling of the heart of russia not only did it seem to him as to all administrators that he controlled the external actions of moscows inhabitants but he also thought he controlled their mental attitude by means of his broadsheets and posters written in a coarse tone which the people despise in their own class and do not understand from those in authority rostopchin was so pleased with the fine role of leader of popular feeling and had grown so used to it that the necessity of relinquishing that role and abandoning moscow without any heroic display took him unawares and he suddenly felt the ground slip away from under his feet so that he positively did not know what to do though he knew it was coming he did not till the last moment wholeheartedly believe that moscow would be abandoned and did not prepare for it the inhabitants left against his wishes if the government offices were removed this was only done on the demand of officials to whom the count yielded reluctantly he was absorbed in the role he had created for himself as is often the case with those gifted with an ardent imagination though he had long known that moscow would be abandoned he knew it only with his intellect he did not believe it in his heart and did not adapt himself mentally to this new position of affairs all his painstaking and energetic activity in how far it was useful and had any effect on the people is another question had been simply directed toward arousing in the masses his own feeling of patriotic hatred of the french but when events assumed their true historical character when expressing hatred for the french in words proved insufficient when it was not even possible to express that hatred by fighting a battle when selfconfidence was of no avail in relation to the one question before moscow when the whole population streamed out of moscow as one man abandoning their belongings and proving by that negative action all the depth of their national feeling then the role chosen by rostopchin suddenly appeared senseless he unexpectedly felt himself ridiculous weak and alone with no ground to stand on when awakened from his sleep he received that cold peremptory note from kutuzov he felt the more irritated the more he felt himself to blame all that he had been specially put in charge of the state property which he should have removed was still in moscow and it was no longer possible to take the whole of it away who is to blame for it who has let things come to such a pass he ruminated not i of course i had everything ready i had moscow firmly in hand and this is what they have let it come to villains traitors he thought without clearly defining who the villains and traitors were but feeling it necessary to hate those traitors whoever they might be who were to blame for the false and ridiculous position in which he found himself all that night count rostopchin issued orders for which people came to him from all parts of moscow those about him had never seen the count so morose and irritable your excellency the director of the registrars department has sent for instructions from the consistory from the senate from the university from the foundling hospital the suffragan has sent asking for information what are your orders about the fire brigade from the governor of the prison from the superintendent of the lunatic asylum all night long such announcements were continually being received by the count to all these inquiries he gave brief and angry replies indicating that orders from him were not now needed that the whole affair carefully prepared by him had now been ruined by somebody and that that somebody would have to bear the whole responsibility for all that might happen oh tell that blockhead he said in reply to the question from the registrars department that he should remain to guard his documents now why are you asking silly questions about the fire brigade they have horses let them be off to vladimir and not leave them to the french your excellency the superintendent of the lunatic asylum has come what are your commands my commands let them go away thats all and let the lunatics out into the town when lunatics command our armies god evidently means these other madmen to be free in reply to an inquiry about the convicts in the prison count rostopchin shouted angrily at the governor do you expect me to give you two battalionswhich we have not got for a convoy release them thats all about it your excellency there are some political prisoners meshkov vereshchagin vereshchagin hasnt he been hanged yet shouted rostopchin bring him to me chapter xxv toward nine oclock in the morning when the troops were already moving through moscow nobody came to the count any more for instructions those who were able to get away were going of their own accord those who remained behind decided for themselves what they must do the count ordered his carriage that he might drive to sokolniki and sat in his study with folded hands morose sallow and taciturn in quiet and untroubled times it seems to every administrator that it is only by his efforts that the whole population under his rule is kept going and in this consciousness of being indispensable every administrator finds the chief reward of his labor and efforts while the sea of history remains calm the ruleradministrator in his frail bark holding on with a boat hook to the ship of the people and himself moving naturally imagines that his efforts move the ship he is holding on to but as soon as a storm arises and the sea begins to heave and the ship to move such a delusion is no longer possible the ship moves independently with its own enormous motion the boat hook no longer reaches the moving vessel and suddenly the administrator instead of appearing a ruler and a source of power becomes an insignificant useless feeble man rostopchin felt this and it was this which exasperated him the superintendent of police whom the crowd had stopped went in to see him at the same time as an adjutant who informed the count that the horses were harnessed they were both pale and the superintendent of police after reporting that he had executed the instructions he had received informed the count that an immense crowd had collected in the courtyard and wished to see him without saying a word rostopchin rose and walked hastily to his light luxurious drawing room went to the balcony door took hold of the handle let it go again and went to the window from which he had a better view of the whole crowd the tall lad was standing in front flourishing his arm and saying something with a stern look the blood stained smith stood beside him with a gloomy face a drone of voices was audible through the closed window is my carriage ready asked rostopchin stepping back from the window it is your excellency replied the adjutant rostopchin went again to the balcony door but what do they want he asked the superintendent of police your excellency they say they have got ready according to your orders to go against the french and they shouted something about treachery but it is a turbulent crowd your excellencyi hardly managed to get away from it your excellency i venture to suggest you may go i dont need you to tell me what to do exclaimed rostopchin angrily he stood by the balcony door looking at the crowd this is what they have done with russia this is what they have done with me thought he full of an irrepressible fury that welled up within him against the someone to whom what was happening might be attributed as often happens with passionate people he was mastered by anger but was still seeking an object on which to vent it here is that mob the dregs of the people he thought as he gazed at the crowd this rabble they have roused by their folly they want a victim he thought as he looked at the tall lad flourishing his arm and this thought occurred to him just because he himself desired a victim something on which to vent his rage is the carriage ready he asked again yes your excellency what are your orders about vereshchagin he is waiting at the porch said the adjutant ah exclaimed rostopchin as if struck by an unexpected recollection and rapidly opening the door he went resolutely out onto the balcony the talking instantly ceased hats and caps were doffed and all eyes were raised to the count good morning lads said the count briskly and loudly thank you for coming ill come out to you in a moment but we must first settle with the villain we must punish the villain who has caused the ruin of moscow wait for me and the count stepped as briskly back into the room and slammed the door behind him a murmur of approbation and satisfaction ran through the crowd hell settle with all the villains youll see and you said the french hell show you what law is the mob were saying as if reproving one another for their lack of confidence a few minutes later an officer came hurriedly out of the front door gave an order and the dragoons formed up in line the crowd moved eagerly from the balcony toward the porch rostopchin coming out there with quick angry steps looked hastily around as if seeking someone where is he he inquired and as he spoke he saw a young man coming round the corner of the house between two dragoons he had a long thin neck and his head that had been half shaved was again covered by short hair this young man was dressed in a threadbare blue cloth coat lined with fox fur that had once been smart and dirty hempen convict trousers over which were pulled his thin dirty troddendown boots on his thin weak legs were heavy chains which hampered his irresolute movements ah said rostopchin hurriedly turning away his eyes from the young man in the furlined coat and pointing to the bottom step of the porch put him there the young man in his clattering chains stepped clumsily to the spot indicated holding away with one finger the coat collar which chafed his neck turned his long neck twice this way and that sighed and submissively folded before him his thin hands unused to work for several seconds while the young man was taking his place on the step the silence continued only among the back rows of the people who were all pressing toward the one spot could sighs groans and the shuffling of feet be heard while waiting for the young man to take his place on the step rostopchin stood frowning and rubbing his face with his hand lads said he with a metallic ring in his voice this man vereshchagin is the scoundrel by whose doing moscow is perishing the young man in the furlined coat stooping a little stood in a submissive attitude his fingers clasped before him his emaciated young face disfigured by the halfshaven head hung down hopelessly at the counts first words he raised it slowly and looked up at him as if wishing to say something or at least to meet his eye but rostopchin did not look at him a vein in the young mans long thin neck swelled like a cord and went blue behind the ear and suddenly his face flushed all eyes were fixed on him he looked at the crowd and rendered more hopeful by the expression he read on the faces there he smiled sadly and timidly and lowering his head shifted his feet on the step he has betrayed his tsar and his country he had gone over to bonaparte he alone of all the russians has disgraced the russian name he has caused moscow to perish said rostopchin in a sharp even voice but suddenly he glanced down at vereshchagin who continued to stand in the same submissive attitude as if inflamed by the sight he raised his arm and addressed the people almost shouting deal with him as you think fit i hand him over to you the crowd remained silent and only pressed closer and closer to one another to keep one another back to breathe in that stifling atmosphere to be unable to stir and to await something unknown uncomprehended and terrible was becoming unbearable those standing in front who had seen and heard what had taken place before them all stood with wide open eyes and mouths straining with all their strength and held back the crowd that was pushing behind them beat him let the traitor perish and not disgrace the russian name shouted rostopchin cut him down i command it hearing not so much the words as the angry tone of rostopchins voice the crowd moaned and heaved forward but again paused count exclaimed the timid yet theatrical voice of vereshchagin in the midst of the momentary silence that ensued count one god is above us both he lifted his head and again the thick vein in his thin neck filled with blood and the color rapidly came and went in his face he did not finish what he wished to say cut him down i command it shouted rostopchin suddenly growing pale like vereshchagin draw sabers cried the dragoon officer drawing his own another still stronger wave flowed through the crowd and reaching the front ranks carried it swaying to the very steps of the porch the tall youth with a stony look on his face and rigid and uplifted arm stood beside vereshchagin saber him the dragoon officer almost whispered and one of the soldiers his face all at once distorted with fury struck vereshchagin on the head with the blunt side of his saber ah cried vereshchagin in meek surprise looking round with a frightened glance as if not understanding why this was done to him a similar moan of surprise and horror ran through the crowd o lord exclaimed a sorrowful voice but after the exclamation of surprise that had escaped from vereshchagin he uttered a plaintive cry of pain and that cry was fatal the barrier of human feeling strained to the utmost that had held the crowd in check suddenly broke the crime had begun and must now be completed the plaintive moan of reproach was drowned by the threatening and angry roar of the crowd like the seventh and last wave that shatters a ship that last irresistible wave burst from the rear and reached the front ranks carrying them off their feet and engulfing them all the dragoon was about to repeat his blow vereshchagin with a cry of horror covering his head with his hands rushed toward the crowd the tall youth against whom he stumbled seized his thin neck with his hands and yelling wildly fell with him under the feet of the pressing struggling crowd some beat and tore at vereshchagin others at the tall youth and the screams of those that were being trampled on and of those who tried to rescue the tall lad only increased the fury of the crowd it was a long time before the dragoons could extricate the bleeding youth beaten almost to death and for a long time despite the feverish haste with which the mob tried to end the work that had been begun those who were hitting throttling and tearing at vereshchagin were unable to kill him for the crowd pressed from all sides swaying as one mass with them in the center and rendering it impossible for them either to kill him or let him go hit him with an ax eh crushed traitor he sold christ still alive tenacious serves him right torture serves a thief right use the hatchet whatstill alive only when the victim ceased to struggle and his cries changed to a longdrawn measured death rattle did the crowd around his prostrate bleeding corpse begin rapidly to change places each one came up glanced at what had been done and with horror reproach and astonishment pushed back again o lord the people are like wild beasts how could he be alive voices in the crowd could be heard saying quite a young fellow too must have been a merchants son what men and they say hes not the right one how not the right one o lord and theres another has been beaten toothey say hes nearly done for oh the people arent they afraid of sinning said the same mob now looking with pained distress at the dead body with its long thin halfsevered neck and its livid face stained with blood and dust a painstaking police officer considering the presence of a corpse in his excellencys courtyard unseemly told the dragoons to take it away two dragoons took it by its distorted legs and dragged it along the ground the gory duststained halfshaven head with its long neck trailed twisting along the ground the crowd shrank back from it at the moment when vereshchagin fell and the crowd closed in with savage yells and swayed about him rostopchin suddenly turned pale and instead of going to the back entrance where his carriage awaited him went with hurried steps and bent head not knowing where and why along the passage leading to the rooms on the ground floor the counts face was white and he could not control the feverish twitching of his lower jaw this way your excellency where are you going this way please said a trembling frightened voice behind him count rostopchin was unable to reply and turning obediently went in the direction indicated at the back entrance stood his caleche the distant roar of the yelling crowd was audible even there he hastily took his seat and told the coachman to drive him to his country house in sokolniki when they reached the myasnitski street and could no longer hear the shouts of the mob the count began to repent he remembered with dissatisfaction the agitation and fear he had betrayed before his subordinates the mob is terribledisgusting he said to himself in french they are like wolves whom nothing but flesh can appease count one god is above us bothvereshchagins words suddenly recurred to him and a disagreeable shiver ran down his back but this was only a momentary feeling and count rostopchin smiled disdainfully at himself i had other duties thought he the people had to be appeased many other victims have perished and are perishing for the public goodand he began thinking of his social duties to his family and to the city entrusted to him and of himselfnot himself as theodore vasilyevich rostopchin he fancied that theodore vasilyevich rostopchin was sacrificing himself for the public good but himself as governor the representative of authority and of the tsar had i been simply theodore vasilyevich my course of action would have been quite different but it was my duty to safeguard my life and dignity as commander in chief lightly swaying on the flexible springs of his carriage and no longer hearing the terrible sounds of the crowd rostopchin grew physically calm and as always happens as soon as he became physically tranquil his mind devised reasons why he should be mentally tranquil too the thought which tranquillized rostopchin was not a new one since the world began and men have killed one another no one has ever committed such a crime against his fellow man without comforting himself with this same idea this idea is le bien public the hypothetical welfare of other people to a man not swayed by passion that welfare is never certain but he who commits such a crime always knows just where that welfare lies and rostopchin now knew it not only did his reason not reproach him for what he had done but he even found cause for selfsatisfaction in having so successfully contrived to avail himself of a convenient opportunity to punish a criminal and at the same time pacify the mob vereshchagin was tried and condemned to death thought rostopchin though the senate had only condemned vereshchagin to hard labor he was a traitor and a spy i could not let him go unpunished and so i have killed two birds with one stone to appease the mob i gave them a victim and at the same time punished a miscreant having reached his country house and begun to give orders about domestic arrangements the count grew quite tranquil half an hour later he was driving with his fast horses across the sokolniki field no longer thinking of what had occurred but considering what was to come he was driving to the yauza bridge where he had heard that kutuzov was count rostopchin was mentally preparing the angry and stinging reproaches he meant to address to kutuzov for his deception he would make that foxy old courtier feel that the responsibility for all the calamities that would follow the abandonment of the city and the ruin of russia as rostopchin regarded it would fall upon his doting old head planning beforehand what he would say to kutuzov rostopchin turned angrily in his caleche and gazed sternly from side to side the sokolniki field was deserted only at the end of it in front of the almshouse and the lunatic asylum could be seen some people in white and others like them walking singly across the field shouting and gesticulating one of these was running to cross the path of count rostopchins carriage and the count himself his coachman and his dragoons looked with vague horror and curiosity at these released lunatics and especially at the one running toward them swaying from side to side on his long thin legs in his fluttering dressing gown this lunatic was running impetuously his gaze fixed on rostopchin shouting something in a hoarse voice and making signs to him to stop the lunatics solemn gloomy face was thin and yellow with its beard growing in uneven tufts his black agate pupils with saffronyellow whites moved restlessly near the lower eyelids stop pull up i tell you he cried in a piercing voice and again shouted something breathlessly with emphatic intonations and gestures coming abreast of the caleche he ran beside it thrice have they slain me thrice have i risen from the dead they stoned me crucified me i shall rise shall rise shall rise they have torn my body the kingdom of god will be overthrown thrice will i overthrow it and thrice reestablish it he cried raising his voice higher and higher count rostopchin suddenly grew pale as he had done when the crowd closed in on vereshchagin he turned away go fas faster he cried in a trembling voice to his coachman the caleche flew over the ground as fast as the horses could draw it but for a long time count rostopchin still heard the insane despairing screams growing fainter in the distance while his eyes saw nothing but the astonished frightened bloodstained face of the traitor in the furlined coat recent as that mental picture was rostopchin already felt that it had cut deep into his heart and drawn blood even now he felt clearly that the gory trace of that recollection would not pass with time but that the terrible memory would on the contrary dwell in his heart ever more cruelly and painfully to the end of his life he seemed still to hear the sound of his own words cut him down i command it why did i utter those words it was by some accident i said them i need not have said them he thought and then nothing would have happened he saw the frightened and then infuriated face of the dragoon who dealt the blow the look of silent timid reproach that boy in the furlined coat had turned upon him but i did not do it for my own sake i was bound to act that way the mob the traitor the public welfare thought he troops were still crowding at the yauza bridge it was hot kutuzov dejected and frowning sat on a bench by the bridge toying with his whip in the sand when a caleche dashed up noisily a man in a generals uniform with plumes in his hat went up to kutuzov and said something in french it was count rostopchin he told kutuzov that he had come because moscow the capital was no more and only the army remained things would have been different if your serene highness had not told me that you would not abandon moscow without another battle all this would not have happened he said kutuzov looked at rostopchin as if not grasping what was said to him he was trying to read something peculiar written at that moment on the face of the man addressing him rostopchin grew confused and became silent kutuzov slightly shook his head and not taking his penetrating gaze from rostopchins face muttered softly no i shall not give up moscow without a battle whether kutuzov was thinking of something entirely different when he spoke those words or uttered them purposely knowing them to be meaningless at any rate rostopchin made no reply and hastily left him and strange to say the governor of moscow the proud count rostopchin took up a cossack whip and went to the bridge where he began with shouts to drive on the carts that blocked the way chapter xxvi toward four oclock in the afternoon murats troops were entering moscow in front rode a detachment of wurttemberg hussars and behind them rode the king of naples himself accompanied by a numerous suite about the middle of the arbat street near the church of the miraculous icon of st nicholas murat halted to await news from the advanced detachment as to the condition in which they had found the citadel le kremlin around murat gathered a group of those who had remained in moscow they all stared in timid bewilderment at the strange longhaired commander dressed up in feathers and gold is that their tsar himself hes not bad low voices could be heard saying an interpreter rode up to the group take off your cap your caps these words went from one to another in the crowd the interpreter addressed an old porter and asked if it was far to the kremlin the porter listening in perplexity to the unfamiliar polish accent and not realizing that the interpreter was speaking russian did not understand what was being said to him and slipped behind the others murat approached the interpreter and told him to ask where the russian army was one of the russians understood what was asked and several voices at once began answering the interpreter a french officer returning from the advanced detachment rode up to murat and reported that the gates of the citadel had been barricaded and that there was probably an ambuscade there good said murat and turning to one of the gentlemen in his suite ordered four light guns to be moved forward to fire at the gates the guns emerged at a trot from the column following murat and advanced up the arbat when they reached the end of the vozdvizhenka street they halted and drew in the square several french officers superintended the placing of the guns and looked at the kremlin through field glasses the bells in the kremlin were ringing for vespers and this sound troubled the french they imagined it to be a call to arms a few infantrymen ran to the kutafyev gate beams and wooden screens had been put there and two musket shots rang out from under the gate as soon as an officer and men began to run toward it a general who was standing by the guns shouted some words of command to the officer and the latter ran back again with his men the sound of three more shots came from the gate one shot struck a french soldiers foot and from behind the screens came the strange sound of a few voices shouting instantly as at a word of command the expression of cheerful serenity on the faces of the french general officers and men changed to one of determined concentrated readiness for strife and suffering to all of them from the marshal to the least soldier that place was not the vozdvizhenka mokhavaya or kutafyev street nor the troitsa gate places familiar in moscow but a new battlefield which would probably prove sanguinary and all made ready for that battle the cries from the gates ceased the guns were advanced the artillerymen blew the ash off their linstocks and an officer gave the word fire this was followed by two whistling sounds of canister shot one after another the shot rattled against the stone of the gate and upon the wooden beams and screens and two wavering clouds of smoke rose over the square a few instants after the echo of the reports resounding over the stonebuilt kremlin had died away the french heard a strange sound above their head thousands of crows rose above the walls and circled in the air cawing and noisily flapping their wings together with that sound came a solitary human cry from the gateway and amid the smoke appeared the figure of a bareheaded man in a peasants coat he grasped a musket and took aim at the french fire repeated the officer once more and the reports of a musket and of two cannon shots were heard simultaneously the gate again hidden by smoke nothing more stirred behind the screens and the french infantry soldiers and officers advanced to the gate in the gateway lay three wounded and four dead two men in peasant coats ran away at the foot of the wall toward the znamenka clear that away said the officer pointing to the beams and the corpses and the french soldiers after dispatching the wounded threw the corpses over the parapet who these men were nobody knew clear that away was all that was said of them and they were thrown over the parapet and removed later on that they might not stink thiers alone dedicates a few eloquent lines to their memory these wretches had occupied the sacred citadel having supplied themselves with guns from the arsenal and fired the wretches at the french some of them were sabered and the kremlin was purged of their presence murat was informed that the way had been cleared the french entered the gates and began pitching their camp in the senate square out of the windows of the senate house the soldiers threw chairs into the square for fuel and kindled fires there other detachments passed through the kremlin and encamped along the moroseyka the lubyanka and pokrovka streets others quartered themselves along the vozdvizhenka the nikolski and the tverskoy streets no masters of the houses being found anywhere the french were not billeted on the inhabitants as is usual in towns but lived in it as in a camp though tattered hungry worn out and reduced to a third of their original number the french entered moscow in good marching order it was a weary and famished but still a fighting and menacing army but it remained an army only until its soldiers had dispersed into their different lodgings as soon as the men of the various regiments began to disperse among the wealthy and deserted houses the army was lost forever and there came into being something nondescript neither citizens nor soldiers but what are known as marauders when five weeks later these same men left moscow they no longer formed an army they were a mob of marauders each carrying a quantity of articles which seemed to him valuable or useful the aim of each man when he left moscow was no longer as it had been to conquer but merely to keep what he had acquired like a monkey which puts its paw into the narrow neck of a jug and having seized a handful of nuts will not open its fist for fear of losing what it holds and therefore perishes the french when they left moscow had inevitably to perish because they carried their loot with them yet to abandon what they had stolen was as impossible for them as it is for the monkey to open its paw and let go of its nuts ten minutes after each regiment had entered a moscow district not a soldier or officer was left men in military uniforms and hessian boots could be seen through the windows laughing and walking through the rooms in cellars and storerooms similar men were busy among the provisions and in the yards unlocking or breaking open coach house and stable doors lighting fires in kitchens and kneading and baking bread with rolledup sleeves and cooking or frightening amusing or caressing women and children there were many such men both in the shops and housesbut there was no army order after order was issued by the french commanders that day forbidding the men to disperse about the town sternly forbidding any violence to the inhabitants or any looting and announcing a roll call for that very evening but despite all these measures the men who had till then constituted an army flowed all over the wealthy deserted city with its comforts and plentiful supplies as a hungry herd of cattle keeps well together when crossing a barren field but gets out of hand and at once disperses uncontrollably as soon as it reaches rich pastures so did the army disperse all over the wealthy city no residents were left in moscow and the soldierslike water percolating through sandspread irresistibly through the city in all directions from the kremlin into which they had first marched the cavalry on entering a merchants house that had been abandoned and finding there stabling more than sufficient for their horses went on all the same to the next house which seemed to them better many of them appropriated several houses chalked their names on them and quarreled and even fought with other companies for them before they had had time to secure quarters the soldiers ran out into the streets to see the city and hearing that everything had been abandoned rushed to places where valuables were to be had for the taking the officers followed to check the soldiers and were involuntarily drawn into doing the same in carriage row carriages had been left in the shops and generals flocked there to select caleches and coaches for themselves the few inhabitants who had remained invited commanding officers to their houses hoping thereby to secure themselves from being plundered there were masses of wealth and there seemed no end to it all around the quarters occupied by the french were other regions still unexplored and unoccupied where they thought yet greater riches might be found and moscow engulfed the army ever deeper and deeper when water is spilled on dry ground both the dry ground and the water disappear and mud results and in the same way the entry of the famished army into the rich and deserted city resulted in fires and looting and the destruction of both the army and the wealthy city the french attributed the fire of moscow au patriotisme feroce de rostopchine the russians to the barbarity of the french in reality however it was not and could not be possible to explain the burning of moscow by making any individual or any group of people responsible for it moscow was burned because it found itself in a position in which any town built of wood was bound to burn quite apart from whether it had or had not a hundred and thirty inferior fire engines deserted moscow had to burn as inevitably as a heap of shavings has to burn on which sparks continually fall for several days a town built of wood where scarcely a day passes without conflagrations when the house owners are in residence and a police force is present cannot help burning when its inhabitants have left it and it is occupied by soldiers who smoke pipes make campfires of the senate chairs in the senate square and cook themselves meals twice a day in peacetime it is only necessary to billet troops in the villages of any district and the number of fires in that district immediately increases how much then must the probability of fire be increased in an abandoned wooden town where foreign troops are quartered le patriotisme feroce de rostopchine and the barbarity of the french were not to blame in the matter moscow was set on fire by the soldiers pipes kitchens and campfires and by the carelessness of enemy soldiers occupying houses they did not own even if there was any arson which is very doubtful for no one had any reason to burn the housesin any case a troublesome and dangerous thing to do arson cannot be regarded as the cause for the same thing would have happened without any incendiarism to rostopchins ferocious patriotism however tempting it might be for the french to blame rostopchins ferocity and for russians to blame the scoundrel bonaparte or later on to place an heroic torch in the hands of their own people it is impossible not to see that there could be no such direct cause of the fire for moscow had to burn as every village factory or house must burn which is left by its owners and in which strangers are allowed to live and cook their porridge moscow was burned by its inhabitants it is true but by those who had abandoned it and not by those who remained in it moscow when occupied by the enemy did not remain intact like berlin vienna and other towns simply because its inhabitants abandoned it and did not welcome the french with bread and salt nor bring them the keys of the city chapter xxvii the absorption of the french by moscow radiating starwise as it did only reached the quarter where pierre was staying by the evening of the second of september after the last two days spent in solitude and unusual circumstances pierre was in a state bordering on insanity he was completely obsessed by one persistent thought he did not know how or when this thought had taken such possession of him but he remembered nothing of the past understood nothing of the present and all he saw and heard appeared to him like a dream he had left home only to escape the intricate tangle of lifes demands that enmeshed him and which in his present condition he was anna pavlovnas presentiment was in fact fulfilled next day during the service at the palace church in honor of the emperors birthday prince volkonski was called out of the church and received a dispatch from prince kutuzov it was kutuzovs report written from tatarinova on the day of the battle kutuzov wrote that the russians had not retreated a step that the french losses were much heavier than ours and that he was writing in haste from the field of battle before collecting full information it followed that there must have been a victory and at once without leaving the church thanks were rendered to the creator for his help and for the victory anna pavlovnas presentiment was justified and all that morning a joyously festive mood reigned in the city everyone believed the victory to have been complete and some even spoke of napoleons having been captured of his deposition and of the choice of a new ruler for france it is very difficult for events to be reflected in their real strength and completeness amid the conditions of court life and far from the scene of action general events involuntarily group themselves around some particular incident so now the courtiers pleasure was based as much on the fact that the news had arrived on the emperors birthday as on the fact of the victory itself it was like a successfully arranged surprise mention was made in kutuzovs report of the russian losses among which figured the names of tuchkov bagration and kutaysov in the petersburg world this sad side of the affair again involuntarily centered round a single incident kutaysovs death everybody knew him the emperor liked him and he was young and interesting that day everyone met with the words a charming lady a divine one her eyes nicholas looked at his partner are blue her mouth coral and ivory her figure he glanced at her shoulders like dianas the governors wife led him up to a tall and very stout old lady with a blue headdress who had just finished her game of cards with the most important personages of the town this was malvintseva princess marys aunt on her mothers side a rich childless widow who always lived in voronezh when rostov approached her she was standing settling up for the game she looked at him and screwing up her eyes sternly continued to upbraid the general who had won from her very pleased mon cher she then said holding out her hand to nicholas pray come and see me after a few words about princess mary and her late father whom malvintseva had evidently not liked and having asked what nicholas knew of prince andrew who also was evidently no favorite of hers the important old lady dismissed nicholas after repeating her invitation to come to see her nicholas promised to come and blushed again as he bowed at the mention of princess mary he experienced a feeling of shyness and even of fear which he himself did not understand when he had parted from malvintseva nicholas wished to return to the dancing but the governors little wife placed her plump hand on his sleeve and saying that she wanted to have a talk with him led him to her sitting room from which those who were there immediately withdrew so as not to be in her way do you know dear boy began the governors wife with a serious expression on her kind little face that really would be the match for you would you like me to arrange it whom do you mean aunt asked nicholas i will make a match for you with the princess catherine petrovna speaks of lily but i say nothe princess do you want me to do it i am sure your mother will be grateful to me what a charming girl she is really and she is not at all so plain either not at all replied nicholas as if offended at the idea as befits a soldier aunt i dont force myself on anyone or refuse anything he said before he had time to consider what he was saying well then remember this is not a joke of course not yes yes the governors wife said as if talking to herself but my dear boy among other things you are too attentive to the other the blonde one is sorry for the husband really oh no we are good friends with him said nicholas in the simplicity of his heart it did not enter his head that a pastime so pleasant to himself might not be pleasant to someone else but what nonsense i have been saying to the governors wife thought nicholas suddenly at supper she will really begin to arrange a match and soyna and on taking leave of the governors wife when she again smilingly said to him well then remember he drew her aside but see here to tell the truth aunt what is it my dear come lets sit down here said she nicholas suddenly felt a desire and need to tell his most intimate thoughts which he would not have told to his mother his sister or his friend to this woman who was almost a stranger when he afterwards recalled that impulse to unsolicited and inexplicable frankness which had very important results for him it seemed to himas it seems to everyone in such casesthat it was merely some silly whim that seized him yet that burst of frankness together with other trifling events had immense consequences for him and for all his family you see aunt mamma has long wanted me to marry an heiress but the very idea of marrying for money is repugnant to me oh yes i understand said the governors wife but princess bolkonskayathats another matter i will tell you the truth in the first place i like her very much i feel drawn to her and then after i met her under such circumstancesso strangely the idea often occurred to me this is fate especially if you remember that mamma had long been thinking of it but i had never happened to meet her before somehow it had always happened that we did not meet and as long as my sister natasha was engaged to her brother it was of course out of the question for me to think of marrying her and it must needs happen that i should meet her just when natashas engagement had been broken off and then everything so you see i never told this to anyone and never will only to you the governors wife pressed his elbow gratefully you know sonya my cousin i love her and promised to marry her and will do so so you see there can be no question about said nicholas incoherently and blushing my dear boy what a way to look at it you know sonya has nothing and you yourself say your papas affairs are in a very bad way and what about your mother it would kill her thats one thing and what sort of life would it be for sonyaif shes a girl with a heart your mother in despair and you all ruined no my dear you and sonya ought to understand that nicholas remained silent it comforted him to hear these arguments all the same aunt it is impossible he rejoined with a sigh after a short pause besides would the princess have me and besides she is now in mourning how can one think of it but you dont suppose im going to get you married at once there is always a right way of doing things replied the governors wife what a matchmaker you are aunt said nicholas kissing her plump little hand chapter vi on reaching moscow after her meeting with rostov princess mary had found her nephew there with his tutor and a letter from prince andrew giving her instructions how to get to her aunt malvintseva at voronezh that feeling akin to temptation which had tormented her during her fathers illness since his death and especially since her meeting with rostov was smothered by arrangements for the journey anxiety about her brother settling in a new house meeting new people and attending to her nephews education she was sad now after a month passed in quiet surroundings she felt more and more deeply the loss of her father which was associated in her mind with the ruin of russia she was agitated and incessantly tortured by the thought of the dangers to which her brother the only intimate person now remaining to her was exposed she was worried too about her nephews education for which she had always felt herself incompetent but in the depths of her soul she felt at peacea peace arising from consciousness of having stifled those personal dreams and hopes that had been on the point of awakening within her and were related to her meeting with rostov the day after her party the governors wife came to see malvintseva and after discussing her plan with the aunt remarked that though under present circumstances a formal betrothal was of course not to be thought of all the same the young people might be brought together and could get to know one another malvintseva expressed approval and the governors wife began to speak of rostov in marys presence praising him and telling how he had blushed when princess marys name was mentioned but princess mary experienced a painful rather than a joyful feelingher mental tranquillity was destroyed and desires doubts selfreproach and hopes reawoke during the two days that elapsed before rostov called princess mary continually thought of how she ought to behave to him first she decided not to come to the drawing room when he called to see her auntthat it would not be proper for her in her deep mourning to receive visitors then she thought this would be rude after what he had done for her then it occurred to her that her aunt and the governors wife had intentions concerning herself and rostovtheir looks and words at times seemed to confirm this suppositionthen she told herself that only she with her sinful nature could think this of them they could not forget that situated as she was while still wearing deep mourning such matchmaking would be an insult to her and to her fathers memory assuming that she did go down to see him princess mary imagined the words he would say to her and what she would say to him and these words sometimes seemed undeservedly cold and then to mean too much more than anything she feared lest the confusion she felt might overwhelm her and betray her as soon as she saw him but when on sunday after church the footman announced in the drawing room that count rostov had called the princess showed no confusion only a slight blush suffused her cheeks and her eyes lit up with a new and radiant light you have met him aunt said she in a calm voice unable herself to understand that she could be outwardly so calm and natural when rostov entered the room the princess dropped her eyes for an instant as if to give the visitor time to greet her aunt and then just as nicholas turned to her she raised her head and met his look with shining eyes with a movement full of dignity and grace she half rose with a smile of pleasure held out her slender delicate hand to him and began to speak in a voice in which for the first time new deep womanly notes vibrated mademoiselle bourienne who was in the drawing room looked at princess mary in bewildered surprise herself a consummate coquette she could not have maneuvered better on meeting a man she wished to attract either black is particularly becoming to her or she really has greatly improved without my having noticed it and above all what tact and grace thought mademoiselle bourienne had princess mary been capable of reflection at that moment she would have been more surprised than mademoiselle bourienne at the change that had taken place in herself from the moment she recognized that dear loved face a new life force took possession of her and compelled her to speak and act apart from her own will from the time rostov entered her face became suddenly transformed it was as if a light had been kindled in a carved and painted lantern and the intricate skillful artistic work on its sides that previously seemed dark coarse and meaningless was suddenly shown up in unexpected and striking beauty for the first time all that pure spiritual inward travail through which she had lived appeared on the surface all her inward labor her dissatisfaction with herself her sufferings her strivings after goodness her meekness love and selfsacrificeall this now shone in those radiant eyes in her delicate smile and in every trait of her gentle face rostov saw all this as clearly as if he had known her whole life he felt that the being before him was quite different from and better than anyone he had met before and above all better than himself their conversation was very simple and unimportant they spoke of the war and like everyone else unconsciously exaggerated their sorrow about it they spoke of their last meetingnicholas trying to change the subjectthey talked of the governors kind wife of nicholas relations and of princess marys she did not talk about her brother diverting the conversation as soon as her aunt mentioned andrew evidently she could speak of russias misfortunes with a certain artificiality but her brother was too near her heart and she neither could nor would speak lightly of him nicholas noticed this as he noticed every shade of princess marys character with an observation unusual to him and everything confirmed his conviction that she was a quite unusual and extraordinary being nicholas blushed and was confused when people spoke to him about the princess as she did when he was mentioned and even when he thought of her but in her presence he felt quite at ease and said not at all what he had prepared but what quite appropriately occurred to him at the moment when a pause occurred during his short visit nicholas as is usual when there are children turned to prince andrews little son caressing him and asking whether he would like to be an hussar he took the boy on his knee played with him and looked round at princess mary with a softened happy timid look she watched the boy she loved in the arms of the man she loved nicholas also noticed that look and as if understanding it flushed with pleasure and began to kiss the boy with good natured playfulness as she was in mourning princess mary did not go out into society and nicholas did not think it the proper thing to visit her again but all the same the governors wife went on with her matchmaking passing on to nicholas the flattering things princess mary said of him and vice versa and insisting on his declaring himself to princess mary for this purpose she arranged a meeting between the young people at the bishops house before mass though rostov told the governeors wife that he would not make any declaration to princess mary he promised to go as at tilsit rostov had not allowed himself to doubt that what everybody considered right was right so now after a short but sincere struggle between his effort to arrange his life by his own sense of justice and in obedient submission to circumstances he chose the latter and yielded to the power he felt irresistibly carrying him he knew not where he knew that after his promise to sonya it would be what he deemed base to declare his feelings to princess mary and he knew that he would never act basely but he also knew or rather felt at the bottom of his heart that by resigning himself now to the force of circumstances and to those who were guiding him he was not only doing nothing wrong but was doing something very importantmore important than anything he had ever done in his life after meeting princess mary though the course of his life went on externally as before all his former amusements lost their charm for him and he often thought about her but he never thought about her as he had thought of all the young ladies without exception whom he had met in society nor as he had for a long time and at one time rapturously thought about sonya he had pictured each of those young ladies as almost all honesthearted young men do that is as a possible wife adapting her in his imagination to all the conditions of married life a white dressing gown his wife at the tea table his wifes carriage little ones mamma and papa their relations to her and so onand these pictures of the future had given him pleasure but with princess mary to whom they were trying to get him engaged he could never picture anything of future married life if he tried his pictures seemed incongruous and false it made him afraid chapter vii the dreadful news of the battle of borodino of our losses in killed and wounded and the still more terrible news of the loss of moscow reached voronezh in the middle of september princess mary having learned of her brothers wound only from the gazette and having no definite news of him prepared so nicholas heard he had not seen her again himself to set off in search of prince andrew when he received the news of the battle of borodino and the abandonment of moscow rostov was not seized with despair anger the desire for vengeance or any feeling of that kind but everything in voronezh suddenly seemed to him dull and tiresome and he experienced an indefinite feeling of shame and awkwardness the conversations he heard seemed to him insincere he did not know how to judge all these affairs and felt that only in the regiment would everything again become clear to him he made haste to finish buying the horses and often became unreasonably angry with his servant and squadron quartermaster a few days before his departure a special thanksgiving at which nicholas was present was held in the cathedral for the russian victory he stood a little behind the governor and held himself with military decorum through the service meditating on a great variety of subjects when the service was over the governors wife beckoned him to her have you seen the princess she asked indicating with a movement of her head a lady standing on the opposite side beyond the choir nicholas immediately recognized princess mary not so much by the profile he saw under her bonnet as by the feeling of solicitude timidity and pity that immediately overcame him princess mary evidently engrossed by her thoughts was crossing herself for the last time before leaving the church nicholas looked at her face with surprise it was the same face he had seen before there was the same general expression of refined inner spiritual labor but now it was quite differently lit up there was a pathetic expression of sorrow prayer and hope in it as had occurred before when she was present nicholas went up to her without waiting to be prompted by the governors wife and not asking himself whether or not it was right and proper to address her here in church and told her he had heard of her trouble and sympathized with his whole soul as soon as she heard his voice a vivid glow kindled in her face lighting up both her sorrow and her joy there is one thing i wanted to tell you princess said rostov it is that if your brother prince andrew nikolievich were not living it would have been at once announced in the gazette as he is a colonel the princess looked at him not grasping what he was saying but cheered by the expression of regretful sympathy on his face and i have known so many cases of a splinter wound the gazette said it was a shell either proving fatal at once or being very slight continued nicholas we must hope for the best and i am sure princess mary interrupted him oh that would be so dread she began and prevented by agitation from finishing she bent her head with a movement as graceful as everything she did in his presence and looking up at him gratefully went out following her aunt that evening nicholas did not go out but stayed at home to settle some accounts with the horse dealers when he had finished that business it was already too late to go anywhere but still too early to go to bed and for a long time he paced up and down the room reflecting on his life a thing he rarely did princess mary had made an agreeable impression on him when he had met her in smolensk province his having encountered her in such exceptional circumstances and his mother having at one time mentioned her to him as a good match had drawn his particular attention to her when he met her again in voronezh the impression she made on him was not merely pleasing but powerful nicholas had been struck by the peculiar moral beauty he observed in her at this time he was however preparing to go away and it had not entered his head to regret that he was thus depriving himself of chances of meeting her but that days encounter in church had he felt sunk deeper than was desirable for his peace of mind that pale sad refined face that radiant look those gentle graceful gestures and especially the deep and tender sorrow expressed in all her features agitated him and evoked his sympathy in men rostov could not bear to see the expression of a higher spiritual life that was why he did not like prince andrew and he referred to it contemptuously as philosophy and dreaminess but in princess mary that very sorrow which revealed the depth of a whole spiritual world foreign to him was an irresistible attraction she must be a wonderful woman a real angel he said to himself why am i not free why was i in such a hurry with sonya and he involuntarily compared the two the lack of spirituality in the one and the abundance of it in the othera spirituality he himself lacked and therefore valued most highly he tried to picture what would happen were he free how he would propose to her and how she would become his wife but no he could not imagine that he felt awed and no clear picture presented itself to his mind he had long ago pictured to himself a future with sonya and that was all clear and simple just because it had all been thought out and he knew all there was in sonya but it was impossible to picture a future with princess mary because he did not understand her but simply loved her reveries about sonya had had something merry and playful in them but to dream of princess mary was always difficult and a little frightening how she prayed he thought it was plain that her whole soul was in her prayer yes that was the prayer that moves mountains and i am sure her prayer will be answered why dont i pray for what i want he suddenly thought what do i want to be free released from sonya she was right he thought remembering what the governors wife had said nothing but misfortune can come of marrying sonya muddles grief for mamma business difficulties muddles terrible muddles besides i dont love hernot as i should o god release me from this dreadful inextricable position he suddenly began to pray yes prayer can move mountains but one must have faith and not pray as natasha and i used to as children that the snow might turn into sugarand then run out into the yard to see whether it had done so no but i am not praying for trifles now he thought as he put his pipe down in a corner and folding his hands placed himself before the icon softened by memories of princess mary he began to pray as he had not done for a long time tears were in his eyes and in his throat when the door opened and lavrushka came in with some papers blockhead why do you come in without being called cried nicholas quickly changing his attitude from the governor said lavrushka in a sleepy voice a courier has arrived and theres a letter for you well all right thanks you can go nicholas took the two letters one of which was from his mother and the other from sonya he recognized them by the handwriting and opened sonyas first he had read only a few lines when he turned pale and his eyes opened wide with fear and joy no its not possible he cried aloud unable to sit still he paced up and down the room holding the letter and reading it he glanced through it then read it again and then again and standing still in the middle of the room he raised his shoulders stretching out his hands with his mouth wide open and his eyes fixed what he had just been praying for with confidence that god would hear him had come to pass but nicholas was as much astonished as if it were something extraordinary and unexpected and as if the very fact that it had happened so quickly proved that it had not come from god to whom he had prayed but by some ordinary coincidence this unexpected and as it seemed to nicholas quite voluntary letter from sonya freed him from the knot that fettered him and from which there had seemed no escape she wrote that the last unfortunate eventsthe loss of almost the whole of the rostovs moscow propertyand the countess repeatedly expressed wish that nicholas should marry princess bolkonskaya together with his silence and coldness of late had all combined to make her decide to release him from his promise and set him completely free it would be too painful to me to think that i might be a cause of sorrow or discord in the family that has been so good to me she wrote and my love has no aim but the happiness of those i love so nicholas i beg you to consider yourself free and to be assured that in spite of everything no one can love you more than does your sonya both letters were written from troitsa the other from the countess described their last days in moscow their departure the fire and the destruction of all their property in this letter the countess also mentioned that prince andrew was among the wounded traveling with them his state was very critical but the doctor said there was now more hope sonya and natasha were nursing him next day nicholas took his mothers letter and went to see princess mary neither he nor she said a word about what natasha nursing him might mean but thanks to this letter nicholas suddenly became almost as intimate with the princess as if they were relations the following day he saw princess mary off on her journey to yaroslavl and a few days later left to rejoin his regiment sonyas letter written from troitsa which had come as an answer to nicholas prayer was prompted by this the thought of getting nicholas married to an heiress occupied the old countess mind more and more she knew that sonya was the chief obstacle to this happening and sonyas life in the countess house had grown harder and harder especially after they had received a letter from nicholas telling of his meeting with princess mary in bogucharovo the countess let no occasion slip of making humiliating or cruel allusions to sonya but a few days before they left moscow moved and excited by all that was going on she called sonya to her and instead of reproaching and making demands on her tearfully implored her to sacrifice herself and repay all that the family had done for her by breaking off her engagement with nicholas i shall not be at peace till you promise me this sonya burst into hysterical tears and replied through her sobs that she would do anything and was prepared for anything but gave no actual promise and could not bring herself to decide to do what was demanded of her she must sacrifice herself for the family that had reared and brought her up to sacrifice herself for others was sonyas habit her position in the house was such that only by sacrifice could she show her worth and she was accustomed to this and loved doing it but in all her former acts of selfsacrifice she had been happily conscious that they raised her in her own esteem and in that of others and so made her more worthy of nicholas whom she loved more than anything in the world but now they wanted her to sacrifice the very thing that constituted the whole reward for her selfsacrifice and the whole meaning of her life and for the first time she felt bitterness against those who had been her benefactors only to torture her the more painfully she felt jealous of natasha who had never experienced anything of this sort had never needed to sacrifice herself but made others sacrifice themselves for her and yet was beloved by everybody and for the first time sonya felt that out of her pure quiet love for nicholas a passionate feeling was beginning to grow up which was stronger than principle virtue or religion under the influence of this feeling sonya whose life of dependence had taught her involuntarily to be secretive having answered the countess in vague general terms avoided talking with her and resolved to wait till she should see nicholas not in order to set him free but on the contrary at that meeting to bind him to her forever the bustle and terror of the rostovs last days in moscow stifled the gloomy thoughts that oppressed sonya she was glad to find escape from them in practical activity but when she heard of prince andrews presence in their house despite her sincere pity for him and for natasha she was seized by a joyful and superstitious feeling that god did not intend her to be separated from nicholas she knew that natasha loved no one but prince andrew and had never ceased to love him she knew that being thrown together again under such terrible circumstances they would again fall in love with one another and that nicholas would then not be able to marry princess mary as they would be within the prohibited degrees of affinity despite all the terror of what had happened during those last days and during the first days of their journey this feeling that providence was intervening in her personal affairs cheered sonya at the troitsa monastery the rostovs first broke their journey for a whole day three large rooms were assigned to them in the monastery hostelry one of which was occupied by prince andrew the wounded man was much better that day and natasha was sitting with him in the next room sat the count and countess respectfully conversing with the prior who was calling on them as old acquaintances and benefactors of the monastery sonya was there too tormented by curiosity as to what prince andrew and natasha were talking about she heard the sound of their voices through the door that door opened and natasha came out looking excited not noticing the monk who had risen to greet her and was drawing back the wide sleeve on his right arm she went up to sonya and took her hand natasha what are you about come here said the countess natasha went up to the monk for his blessing and advised her to pray for aid to god and his saint sonya was not less agitated than her friend by the latters fear and grief and by her own personal feelings which she shared with no one sobbing she kissed and comforted natasha if only he lives she thought having wept talked and wiped away their tears the two friends went together to prince andrews door natasha opened it cautiously and glanced into the room sonya standing beside her at the halfopen door prince andrew was lying raised high on three pillows his pale face was calm his eyes closed and they could see his regular breathing o natasha sonya suddenly almost screamed catching her companions arm and stepping back from the door what what is it asked natasha its that that said sonya with a white face and trembling lips natasha softly closed the door and went with sonya to the window not yet understanding what the latter was telling her you remember said sonya with a solemn and frightened expression you remember when i looked in the mirror for you at otradnoe at christmas do you remember what i saw yes yes cried natasha opening her eyes wide and vaguely recalling that sonya had told her something about prince andrew whom she had seen lying down you remember sonya went on i saw it then and told everybody you and dunyasha i saw him lying on a bed said she making a gesture with her hand and a lifted finger at each detail and that he had his eyes closed and was covered just with a pink quilt and that his hands were folded she concluded convincing herself that the details she had just seen were exactly what she had seen in the mirror she had in fact seen nothing then but had mentioned the first thing that came into her head but what she had invented then seemed to her now as real as any other recollection she not only remembered what she had then saidthat he turned to look at her and smiled and was covered with something redbut was firmly convinced that she had then seen and said that he was covered with a pink quilt and that his eyes were closed yes yes it really was pink cried natasha who now thought she too remembered the word pink being used and saw in this the most extraordinary and mysterious part of the prediction but what does it mean she added meditatively oh i dont know it is all so strange replied sonya clutching at her head a few minutes later prince andrew rang and natasha went to him but sonya feeling unusually excited and touched remained at the window thinking about the strangeness of what had occurred they had an opportunity that day to send letters to the army and the countess was writing to her son sonya said the countess raising her eyes from her letter as her niece passed sonya wont you write to nicholas she spoke in a soft tremulous voice and in the weary eyes that looked over her spectacles sonya read all that the countess meant to convey with these words those eyes expressed entreaty shame at having to ask fear of a refusal and readiness for relentless hatred in case of such refusal sonya was softened excited and touched by all that had occurred that day especially by the mysterious fulfillment she had just seen of her vision now that she knew that the renewal of natashas relations with prince andrew would prevent nicholas from marrying princess mary she was joyfully conscious of a return of that selfsacrificing spirit in which she was accustomed to live and loved to live so with a joyful consciousness of performing a magnanimous deedinterrupted several times by the tears that dimmed her velvety black eyesshe wrote that touching letter the arrival of which had so amazed nicholas chapter ix the officer and soldiers who had arrested pierre treated him with hostility but yet with respect in the guardhouse to which he was taken in their attitude toward him could still be felt both uncertainty as to who he might beperhaps a very important person and hostility as a result of their recent personal conflict with him but when the guard was relieved next morning pierre felt that for the new guardboth officers and menhe was not as interesting as he had been to his captors and in fact the guard of the second day did not recognize in this big stout man in a peasant coat the vigorous person who had fought so desperately with the marauder and the convoy and had uttered those solemn words about saving a child they saw in him only no 17 of the captured russians arrested and detained for some reason by order of the higher command if they noticed anything remarkable about pierre it was only his unabashed meditative concentration and thoughtfulness and the way he spoke french which struck them as surprisingly good in spite of this he was placed that day with the other arrested suspects as the separate room he had occupied was required by an officer all the russians confined with pierre were men of the lowest class and recognizing him as a gentleman they all avoided him more especially as he spoke french pierre felt sad at hearing them making fun of him that evening he learned that all these prisoners he probably among them were to be tried for incendiarism on the third day he was taken with the others to a house where a french general with a white mustache sat with two colonels and other frenchmen with scarves on their arms with the precision and definiteness customary in addressing prisoners and which is supposed to preclude human frailty pierre like the others was questioned as to who he was where he had been with what object and so on these questions like questions put at trials generally left the essence of the matter aside shut out the possibility of that essences being revealed and were designed only to form a channel through which the judges wished the answers of the accused to flow so as to lead to the desired result namely a conviction as soon as pierre began to say anything that did not fit in with that aim the channel was removed and the water could flow to waste pierre felt moreover what the accused always feel at their trial perplexity as to why these questions were put to him he had a feeling that it was only out of condescension or a kind of civility that this device of placing a channel was employed he knew he was in these mens power that only by force had they brought him there that force alone gave them the right to demand answers to their questions and that the sole object of that assembly was to inculpate him and so as they had the power and wish to inculpate him this expedient of an inquiry and trial seemed unnecessary it was evident that any answer would lead to conviction when asked what he was doing when he was arrested pierre replied in a rather tragic manner that he was restoring to its parents a child he had saved from the flames why had he fought the marauder pierre answered that he was protecting a woman and that to protect a woman who was being insulted was the duty of every man that they interrupted him for this was not to the point why was he in the yard of a burning house where witnesses had seen him he replied that he had gone out to see what was happening in moscow again they interrupted him they had not asked where he was going but why he was found near the fire who was he they asked repeating their first question which he had declined to answer again he replied that he could not answer it put that down thats bad very bad sternly remarked the general with the white mustache and red flushed face on the fourth day fires broke out on the zubovski rampart pierre and thirteen others were moved to the coach house of a merchants house near the crimean bridge on his way through the streets pierre felt stifled by the smoke which seemed to hang over the whole city fires were visible on all sides he did not then realize the significance of the burning of moscow and looked at the fires with horror he passed four days in the coach house near the crimean bridge and during that time learned from the talk of the french soldiers that all those confined there were awaiting a decision which might come any day from the marshal what marshal this was pierre could not learn from the soldiers evidently for them the marshal represented a very high and rather mysterious power these first days before the eighth of september when the prisoners were had up for a second examination were the hardest of all for pierre on the eighth of september an officera very important one judging by the respect the guards showed himentered the coach house where the prisoners were this officer probably someone on the staff was holding a paper in his hand and called over all the russians there naming pierre as the man who does not give his name glancing indolently and indifferently at all the prisoners he ordered the officer in charge to have them decently dressed and tidied up before taking them to the marshal an hour later a squad of soldiers arrived and pierre with thirteen others was led to the virgins field it was a fine day sunny after rain and the air was unusually pure the smoke did not hang low as on the day when pierre had been taken from the guardhouse on the zubovski rampart but rose through the pure air in columns no flames were seen but columns of smoke rose on all sides and all moscow as far as pierre could see was one vast charred ruin on all sides there were waste spaces with only stoves and chimney stacks still standing and here and there the blackened walls of some brick houses pierre gazed at the ruins and did not recognize districts he had known well here and there he could see churches that had not been burned the kremlin which was not destroyed gleamed white in the distance with its towers and the belfry of ivan the great the domes of the new convent of the virgin glittered brightly and its bells were ringing particularly clearly these bells reminded pierre that it was sunday and the feast of the nativity of the virgin but there seemed to be no one to celebrate this holiday everywhere were blackened ruins and the few russians to be seen were tattered and frightened people who tried to hide when they saw the french it was plain that the russian nest was ruined and destroyed but in place of the russian order of life that had been destroyed pierre unconsciously felt that a quite different firm french order had been established over this ruined nest he felt this in the looks of the soldiers who marching in regular ranks briskly and gaily were escorting him and the other criminals he felt it in the looks of an important french official in a carriage and pair driven by a soldier whom they met on the way he felt it in the merry sounds of regimental music he heard from the left side of the field and felt and realized it especially from the list of prisoners the french officer had read out when he came that morning pierre had been taken by one set of soldiers and led first to one and then to another place with dozens of other men and it seemed that they might have forgotten him or confused him with the others but no the answers he had given when questioned had come back to him in his designation as the man who does not give his name and under that appellation which to pierre seemed terrible they were now leading him somewhere with unhesitating assurance on their faces that he and all the other prisoners were exactly the ones they wanted and that they were being taken to the proper place pierre felt himself to be an insignificant chip fallen among the wheels of a machine whose action he did not understand but which was working well he and the other prisoners were taken to the right side of the virgins field to a large white house with an immense garden not far from the convent this was prince shcherbitovs house where pierre had often been in other days and which as he learned from the talk of the soldiers was now occupied by the marshal the duke of eckmuhl davout they were taken to the entrance and led into the house one by one pierre was the sixth to enter he was conducted through a glass gallery an anteroom and a hall which were familiar to him into a long low study at the door of which stood an adjutant davout spectacles on nose sat bent over a table at the further end of the room pierre went close up to him but davout evidently consulting a paper that lay before him did not look up without raising his eyes he said in a low voice pierre was silent because he was incapable of uttering a word to him davout was not merely a french general but a man notorious for his cruelty looking at his cold face as he sat like a stern schoolmaster who was prepared to wait awhile for an answer pierre felt that every instant of delay might cost him his life but he did not know what to say he did not venture to repeat what he had said at his first examination yet to disclose his rank and position was dangerous and embarrassing so he was silent but before he had decided what to do davout raised his head pushed his spectacles back on his forehead screwed up his eyes and looked intently at him i know that man he said in a cold measured tone evidently calculated to frighten pierre the chill that had been running down pierres back now seized his head as in a vise you cannot know me general i have never seen you he is a russian spy davout interrupted addressing another general who was present but whom pierre had not noticed davout turned away with an unexpected reverberation in his voice pierre rapidly began no monseigneur he said suddenly remembering that davout was a duke no monseigneur you cannot have known me i am a militia officer and have not quitted moscow monseigneur exclaimed pierre not in an offended but in a pleading voice davout looked up and gazed intently at him for some seconds they looked at one another and that look saved pierre apart from conditions of war and law that look established human relations between the two men at that moment an immense number of things passed dimly through both their minds and they realized that they were both children of humanity and were brothers at the first glance when davout had only raised his head from the papers where human affairs and lives were indicated by numbers pierre was merely a circumstance and davout could have shot him without burdening his conscience with an evil deed but now he saw in him a human being he reflected for a moment how can you show me that you are telling the truth said davout coldly pierre remembered ramballe and named him and his regiment and the street where the house was you are not what you say returned davout in a trembling faltering voice pierre began adducing proofs of the truth of his statements but at that moment an adjutant entered and reported something to davout davout brightened up at the news the adjutant brought and began buttoning up his uniform it seemed that he had quite forgotten pierre when the adjutant reminded him of the prisoner he jerked his head in pierres direction with a frown and ordered him to be led away but where they were to take him pierre did not know back to the coach house or to the place of execution his companions had pointed out to him as they crossed the virgins field he turned his head and saw that the adjutant was putting another question to davout yes of course replied davout but what this yes meant pierre did not know pierre could not afterwards remember how he went whether it was far or in which direction his faculties were quite numbed he was stupefied and noticing nothing around him went on moving his legs as the others did till they all stopped and he stopped too the only thought in his mind at that time was who was it that had really sentenced him to death not the men on the commission that had first examined himnot one of them wished to or evidently could have done it it was not davout who had looked at him in so human a way in another moment davout would have realized that he was doing wrong but just then the adjutant had come in and interrupted him the adjutant also had evidently had no evil intent though he might have refrained from coming in then who was executing him killing him depriving him of lifehim pierre with all his memories aspirations hopes and thoughts who was doing this and pierre felt that it was no one it was a systema concurrence of circumstances a system of some sort was killing himpierredepriving him of life of everything annihilating him from prince shcherbatovs house the prisoners were led straight down the virgins field to the left of the nunnery as far as a kitchen garden in which a post had been set up beyond that post a fresh pit had been dug in the ground and near the post and the pit a large crowd stood in a semicircle the crowd consisted of a few russians and many of napoleons soldiers who were not on dutygermans italians and frenchmen in a variety of uniforms to the right and left of the post stood rows of french troops in blue uniforms with red epaulets and high boots and shakos the prisoners were placed in a certain order according to the list pierre was sixth and were led to the post several drums suddenly began to beat on both sides of them and at that sound pierre felt as if part of his soul had been torn away he lost the power of thinking or understanding he could only hear and see and he had only one wishthat the frightful thing that had to happen should happen quickly pierre looked round at his fellow prisoners and scrutinized them the two first were convicts with shaven heads one was tall and thin the other dark shaggy and sinewy with a flat nose the third was a domestic serf about fortyfive years old with grizzled hair and a plump wellnourished body the fourth was a peasant a very handsome man with a broad lightbrown beard and black eyes the fifth was a factory hand a thin sallowfaced lad of eighteen in a loose coat pierre heard the french consulting whether to shoot them separately or two at a time in couples replied the officer in command in a calm voice there was a stir in the ranks of the soldiers and it was evident that they were all hurryingnot as men hurry to do something they understand but as people hurry to finish a necessary but unpleasant and incomprehensible task a french official wearing a scarf came up to the right of the row of prisoners and read out the sentence in russian and in french then two pairs of frenchmen approached the criminals and at the officers command took the two convicts who stood first in the row the convicts stopped when they reached the post and while sacks were being brought looked dumbly around as a wounded beast looks at an approaching huntsman one crossed himself continually the other scratched his back and made a movement of the lips resembling a smile with hurried hands the soldiers blindfolded them drawing the sacks over their heads and bound them to the post twelve sharpshooters with muskets stepped out of the ranks with a firm regular tread and halted eight paces from the post pierre turned away to avoid seeing what was going to happen suddenly a crackling rolling noise was heard which seemed to him louder than the most terrific thunder and he looked round there was some smoke and the frenchmen were doing something near the pit with pale faces and trembling hands two more prisoners were led up in the same way and with similar looks these two glanced vainly at the onlookers with only a silent appeal for protection in their eyes evidently unable to understand or believe what was going to happen to them they could not believe it because they alone knew what their life meant to them and so they neither understood nor believed that it could be taken from them again pierre did not wish to look and again turned away but again the sound as of a frightful explosion struck his ear and at the same moment he saw smoke blood and the pale scared faces of the frenchmen who were again doing something by the post their trembling hands impeding one another pierre breathing heavily looked around as if asking what it meant the same question was expressed in all the looks that met his on the faces of all the russians and of the french soldiers and officers without exception he read the same dismay horror and conflict that were in his own heart but who after all is doing this they are all suffering as i am who then is it who flashed for an instant through his mind sharpshooters of the 86th forward shouted someone the fifth prisoner the one next to pierre was led awayalone pierre did not understand that he was saved that he and the rest had been brought there only to witness the execution with evergrowing horror and no sense of joy or relief he gazed at what was taking place the fifth man was the factory lad in the loose cloak the moment they laid hands on him he sprang aside in terror and clutched at pierre pierre shuddered and shook himself free the lad was unable to walk they dragged him along holding him up under the arms and he screamed when they got him to the post he grew quiet as if he suddenly understood something whether he understood that screaming was useless or whether he thought it incredible that men should kill him at any rate he took his stand at the post waiting to be blindfolded like the others and like a wounded animal looked around him with glittering eyes pierre was no longer able to turn away and close his eyes his curiosity and agitation like that of the whole crowd reached the highest pitch at this fifth murder like the others this fifth man seemed calm he wrapped his loose cloak closer and rubbed one bare foot with the other when they began to blindfold him he himself adjusted the knot which hurt the back of his head then when they propped him against the bloodstained post he leaned back and not being comfortable in that position straightened himself adjusted his feet and leaned back again more comfortably pierre did not take his eyes from him and did not miss his slightest movement probably a word of command was given and was followed by the reports of eight muskets but try as he would pierre could not afterwards remember having heard the slightest sound of the shots he only saw how the workman suddenly sank down on the cords that held him how blood showed itself in two places how the ropes slackened under the weight of the hanging body and how the workman sat down his head hanging unnaturally and one leg bent under him pierre ran up to the post no one hindered him pale frightened people were doing something around the workman the lower jaw of an old frenchman with a thick mustache trembled as he untied the ropes the body collapsed the soldiers dragged it awkwardly from the post and began pushing it into the pit they all plainly and certainly knew that they were criminals who must hide the traces of their guilt as quickly as possible pierre glanced into the pit and saw that the factory lad was lying with his knees close up to his head and one shoulder higher than the other that shoulder rose and fell rhythmically and convulsively but spadefuls of earth were already being thrown over the whole body one of the soldiers evidently suffering shouted gruffly and angrily at pierre to go back but pierre did not understand him and remained near the post and no one drove him away when the pit had been filled up a command was given pierre was taken back to his place and the rows of troops on both sides of the post made a half turn and went past it at a measured pace the twentyfour sharpshooters with discharged muskets standing in the center of the circle ran back to their places as the companies passed by pierre gazed now with dazed eyes at these sharpshooters who ran in couples out of the circle all but one rejoined their companies this one a young soldier his face deadly pale his shako pushed back and his musket resting on the ground still stood near the pit at the spot from which he had fired he swayed like a drunken man taking some steps forward and back to save himself from falling an old noncommissioned officer ran out of the ranks and taking him by the elbow dragged him to his company the crowd of russians and frenchmen began to disperse they all went away silently and with drooping heads that will teach them to start fires said one of the frenchmen pierre glanced round at the speaker and saw that it was a soldier who was trying to find some relief after what had been done but was not able to do so without finishing what he had begun to say he made a hopeless movement with his arm and went away after the execution pierre was separated from the rest of the prisoners and placed alone in a small ruined and befouled church toward evening a noncommissioned officer entered with two soldiers and told him that he had been pardoned and would now go to the barracks for the prisoners of war without understanding what was said to him pierre got up and went with the soldiers they took him to the upper end of the field where there were some sheds built of charred planks beams and battens and led him into one of them in the darkness some twenty different men surrounded pierre he looked at them without understanding who they were why they were there or what they wanted of him he heard what they said but did not understand the meaning of the words and made no kind of deduction from or application of them he replied to questions they put to him but did not consider who was listening to his replies nor how they would understand them he looked at their faces and figures but they all seemed to him equally meaningless from the moment pierre had witnessed those terrible murders committed by men who did not wish to commit them it was as if the mainspring of his life on which everything depended and which made everything appear alive had suddenly been wrenched out and everything had collapsed into a heap of meaningless rubbish though he did not acknowledge it to himself his faith in the right ordering of the universe in humanity in his own soul and in god had been destroyed he had experienced this before but never so strongly as now when similar doubts had assailed him before they had been the result of his own wrongdoing and at the bottom of his heart he had felt that relief from his despair and from those doubts was to be found within himself but now he felt that the universe had crumbled before his eyes and only meaningless ruins remained and this not by any fault of his own he felt that it was not in his power to regain faith in the meaning of life around him in the darkness men were standing and evidently something about him interested them greatly they were telling him something and asking him something then they led him away somewhere and at last he found himself in a corner of the shed among men who were laughing and talking on all sides well then mates that very prince who some voice at the other end of the shed was saying with a strong emphasis on the word who sitting silent and motionless on a heap of straw against the wall pierre sometimes opened and sometimes closed his eyes but as soon as he closed them he saw before him the dreadful face of the factory ladespecially dreadful because of its simplicityand the faces of the murderers even more dreadful because of their disquiet and he opened his eyes again and stared vacantly into the darkness around him beside him in a stooping position sat a small man of whose presence he was first made aware by a strong smell of perspiration which came from him every time he moved this man was doing something to his legs in the darkness and though pierre could not see his face he felt that the man continually glanced at him on growing used to the darkness pierre saw that the man was taking off his leg bands and the way he did it aroused pierres interest having unwound the string that tied the band on one leg he carefully coiled it up and immediately set to work on the other leg glancing up at pierre while one hand hung up the first string the other was already unwinding the band on the second leg in this way having carefully removed the leg bands by deft circular motions of his arm following one another uninterruptedly the man hung the leg bands up on some pegs fixed above his head then he took out a knife cut something closed the knife placed it under the head of his bed and seating himself comfortably clasped his arms round his lifted knees and fixed his eyes on pierre the latter was conscious of something pleasant comforting and well rounded in these deft movements in the mans wellordered arrangements in his corner and even in his very smell and he looked at the man without taking his eyes from him youve seen a lot of trouble sir eh the little man suddenly said and there was so much kindliness and simplicity in his singsong voice that pierre tried to reply but his jaw trembled and he felt tears rising to his eyes the little fellow giving pierre no time to betray his confusion instantly continued in the same pleasant tones eh lad dont fret said he in the tender singsong caressing voice old russian peasant women employ dont fret friendsuffer an hour live for an age thats how it is my dear fellow and here we live thank heaven without offense among these folk too there are good men as well as bad said he and still speaking he turned on his knees with a supple movement got up coughed and went off to another part of the shed eh you rascal pierre heard the same kind voice saying at the other end of the shed so youve come you rascal she remembers now now thatll do how can one help it lad my name is platon and the surname is karataev he added evidently wishing to make it easier for pierre to address him they call me little falcon in the regiment how is one to help feeling sad moscowshes the mother of cities how can one see all this and not feel sad but the maggot gnaws the cabbage yet dies first thats what the old folks used to tell us he added rapidly who i said karataev i say things happen not as we plan but as god judges he replied thinking that he was repeating what he had said before and immediately continued well and you have you a family estate sir and a house so you have abundance then and a housewife and your old parents are they still living he asked and though it was too dark for pierre to see he felt that a suppressed smile of kindliness puckered the soldiers lips as he put these questions he seemed grieved that pierre had no parents especially that he had no mother a wife for counsel a motherinlaw for welcome but theres none as dear as ones own mother said he well and have you little ones he went on asking again pierres negative answer seemed to distress him and he hastened to add never mind youre young folks yet and please god may still have some the great thing is to live in harmony but its all the same now pierre could not help saying ah my dear fellow rejoined karataev never decline a prison or a beggars sack he seated himself more comfortably and coughed evidently preparing to tell a long story well my dear fellow i was still living at home he began we had a welltodo homestead plenty of land we peasants lived well and our house was one to thank god for when father and we went out mowing there were seven of us we lived well we were real peasants it so happened and platon karataev told a long story of how he had gone into someones copse to take wood how he had been caught by the keeper had been tried flogged and sent to serve as a soldier well lad and a smile changed the tone of his voice we thought it was a misfortune but it turned out a blessing if it had not been for my sin my brother would have had to go as a soldier but he my younger brother had five little ones while i you see only left a wife behind we had a little girl but god took her before i went as a soldier i come home on leave and ill tell you how it was i look and see that they are living better than before the yard full of cattle the women at home two brothers away earning wages and only michael the youngest at home father he says all my children are the same to me it hurts the same whichever finger gets bitten but if platon hadnt been shaved for a soldier michael would have had to go called us all to him and will you believe it placed us in front of the icons michael he says come here and bow down to his feet and you young woman you bow down too and you grandchildren also bow down before him do you understand he says thats how it is dear fellow fate looks for a head but we are always judging thats not wellthats not right our luck is like water in a dragnet you pull at it and it bulges but when youve drawn it out its empty thats how it is twentythree soldiers three officers and two officials were confined in the shed in which pierre had been placed and where he remained for four weeks when pierre remembered them afterwards they all seemed misty figures to him except platon karataev who always remained in his mind a most vivid and precious memory and the personification of everything russian kindly and round when pierre saw his neighbor next morning at dawn the first impression of him as of something round was fully confirmed platons whole figurein a french overcoat girdled with a cord a soldiers cap and bast shoeswas round his head was quite round his back chest shoulders and even his arms which he held as if ever ready to embrace something were rounded his pleasant smile and his large gentle brown eyes were also round platon karataev must have been fifty judging by his stories of campaigns he had been in told as by an old soldier he did not himself know his age and was quite unable to determine it but his brilliantly white strong teeth which showed in two unbroken semicircles when he laughedas he often didwere all sound and good there was not a gray hair in his beard or on his head and his whole body gave an impression of suppleness and especially of firmness and endurance his face despite its fine rounded wrinkles had an expression of innocence and youth his voice was pleasant and musical but the chief peculiarity of his speech was its directness and appositeness it was evident that he never considered what he had said or was going to say and consequently the rapidity and justice of his intonation had an irresistible persuasiveness his physical strength and agility during the first days of his imprisonment were such that he seemed not to know what fatigue and sickness meant every night before lying down he said lord lay me down as a stone and raise me up as a loaf and every morning on getting up he said i lay down and curled up i get up and shake myself and indeed he only had to lie down to fall asleep like a stone and he only had to shake himself to be ready without a moments delay for some work just as children are ready to play directly they awake he could do everything not very well but not badly he baked cooked sewed planed and mended boots he was always busy and only at night allowed himself conversationof which he was fondand songs he did not sing like a trained singer who knows he is listened to but like the birds evidently giving vent to the sounds in the same way that one stretches oneself or walks about to get rid of stiffness and the sounds were always highpitched mournful delicate and almost feminine and his face at such times was very serious having been taken prisoner and allowed his beard to grow he seemed to have thrown off all that had been forced upon him everything military and alien to himselfand had returned to his former peasant habits a soldier on leavea shirt outside breeches he would say he did not like talking about his life as a soldier though he did not complain and often mentioned that he had not been flogged once during the whole of his army service when he related anything it was generally some old and evidently precious memory of his christian life as he called his peasant existence the proverbs of which his talk was full were for the most part not the coarse and indecent saws soldiers employ but those folk sayings which taken without a context seem so insignificant but when used appositely suddenly acquire a significance of profound wisdom he would often say the exact opposite of what he had said on a previous occasion yet both would be right he liked to talk and he talked well adorning his speech with terms of endearment and with folk sayings which pierre thought he invented himself but the chief charm of his talk lay in the fact that the commonest eventssometimes just such as pierre had witnessed without taking notice of them assumed in karataevs a character of solemn fitness he liked to hear the folk tales one of the soldiers used to tell of an evening they were always the same but most of all he liked to hear stories of real life he would smile joyfully when listening to such stories now and then putting in a word or asking a question to make the moral beauty of what he was told clear to himself karataev had no attachments friendships or love as pierre understood them but loved and lived affectionately with everything life brought him in contact with particularly with mannot any particular man but those']\n",
